   "en": "High school senior Aihara Kotoko has had a crush on Irie Naoki since freshman year. But she's been discouraged from confessing to him by a few things: he's a member of \"Class A,\" the top ranking class in school, whereas she's in \"Class F\"; he gets the top score on every exam; and he's so smart, popular, and handsome that he's been class president every year. When Kotoki finally musters up the courage to present him with a love letter, though, Naoki outright refuses it, telling her point blank–with a look of disgust and boredom–that he doesn't like \"stupid girls.\" Poor Kotoko's worst nightmare! Her heart is broken, but then a change in circumstance forces Naoki and Kotoko to be together every day…!?  \n  \nItazura na Kiss is a gem to the shoujo demographic, as it is the mother of a lot of cliches found in today's shoujo series. Despite the fact that it is 2 decades old, it still stands out as unique for it has the series follow the main characters well into their life, over a span of 10 years. It was so popular it inspired popular series like Marmalade Boy and Fruits Basket.   \n  \nHowever, the author had an accident while she was moving homes with her son and husband, and passed away a few months later, leaving her popular manga forever uncompleted. It was adapted into a popular Taiwanese drama under the title \"It Started With a Kiss\", and it even earned sequel. It was also adapted as a short Japanese drama in 1996, and an anime series in 2008, with the anime portraying the author's planned ending."

Tada's stories belong to the shoujo genre of manga and feature love stories centered around young female characters and their love interests. The storylines include comedic moments and are characterised by essential and sharp drawings. Some of Tada's most popular works are Aishite Knight, Itazura na Kiss and Kimi no Na wa Deborah.\n\nAishite Knight portrays the Japanese rock music scene of the early 1980s. The anime series based on Ai Shite Knight was the first ever to feature original songs performed within the episodes. Another of Tada's works, Miha Paradise is also set in the rock 'n' roll world.\n\nItazura na Kiss (Mischievous Kiss) - begun in 1991 and never completed - was by far Tada's most successful work in Japan. It tells the love story between Kotoko and Naoki from high school until after their marriage. The series inspired also an illustrated art book \"Itazura na Kiss Illustration Shuu\" and two novels written by Nori Harata and published in Shueisha's \"Cobalt\" series. In 1996 a live-action Japanese TV series based on Itazura na Kiss was also produced, starring Aiko Satoo as Kotoko and Takashi Kashiwabara as Naoki. In 2005, the series was adapted into a Taiwanese drama under the name of It Started With a Kiss.\n\nKaoru Tada died on 11 March 1999, aged only 38, following a domestic accident that occurred while she was moving to a new house with her husband and son."
