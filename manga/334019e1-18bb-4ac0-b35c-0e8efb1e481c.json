   "en": "On the Hawaiian Islands, siblings Dragona and Jodio Joestar commit petty crimes to provide aid for their ailing mother Barbara Ann. Under the orders of Meryl May Qi, both a crime lord and their high school principal, the siblings work alongside fellow teenagers Usagi Alohaoe and Paco Laburantes. Together, the gang engages in outright robbery, fraudulent activity, and other schemes to rip off unsuspecting tourists and civilians.  Fifteen-year-old Jodio admires his older brother's strong sense of identity and his mother's incredible work ethic, but there is a darkness within him, one characterized by violent outbursts that he carries out with a cold stoicism. Diagnosed as a sociopath, Jodio is quick to brutalize those who threaten his loved ones. His one objective is to make money by any means necessary, both to support his family and to become filthy rich in his own right.  On one particular heist, the gang robs manga artist Rohan Kishibe of a seemingly ordinary lava rock. However, they soon find that the rock draws any object of high value that it touches to its wielder, no matter the distance or bizarre chain of circumstances it takes to get there. With this new power in hand, Jodio and his allies set out to become wealthier than they ever dreamed possible."

     "en": "**Hirohiko Araki** (荒木 飛呂彦, born June 7, 1960) is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1987 and has sold over 100 million copies as of 2016 in Japan alone.\n\nAraki participated in the Junior Baseball Team in primary school and Kendo Club in middle school. He has a pair of twin younger sisters. Because he was often bullied by his sister, he would hide away to read manga. He liked manga when he was a child, so he wants to be a manga artist. His favorite works are Star of the Giants by Kajiwara Ikki , and Babel II by Yokoyama. Araki had the experience of shaking hands with Tezuka Osamu.\n\nHe likes western pop music, horror movies and Italy very much. We can see a lot of the above elements in his representative work JOJO.His painting style was influenced by Renaissance paintings, especially Michelangelo.\n\nHe gets up at 10 a.m. every day, draws a Name on Sunday, finishes the draft from Monday to Thursday, rests on Friday and Saturday, and doesn't stay up late. This work and rest lasted more than ten years . The work and rest of this law is influenced by the manga artist [Akimoto Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/1cd79d33-68b3-4879-b67a-834055ef99eb/akimoto-osamu). Although he is over 50, his face does not show his old state. He is even joked by other manga artists and fans as \"the younger he lives\", \"Immortality\", \"using corrugation or stone ghost face\", \"in fact, he is also a Stand, and his ability is that he will not grow old\"."
