   "en": "Toppu Uno never wanted to race motorcycles. He was perfectly content watching his sister ride—with his eagle eyes, he knew her lap times before the the stopwatch did. When he’s convinced to take a ride on a minibike for the first time, his hours of observation translate into instant skill on the track. But turning a quick lap and winning a race are two very different things, and Toppu’s got a long way to go before he’s ready for the big leagues: MotoGP, the highest level of two-wheeled road racing.  \n  \n- From the mangaka who wrote *[Ah! My Goddess](https://mangadex.org/title/1614/ah-my-goddess)*",
   "pt": "A história segue o Toppu Uno, um garoto que almeja a MotoGP, a \"melhor corrida de motos do mundo\". O mangá conta com \"representações obsessivamente precisas\" de equipamentos mecânicos, motocicletas e carros. O mangá também terá a \"cooperação total\" de vários fabricantes de motocicletas japonesas, empresas de motocicletas e vários circuitos no Japão. Do mesmo autor de Ah! Megami-sama"
