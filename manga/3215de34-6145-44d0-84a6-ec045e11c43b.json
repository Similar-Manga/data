   "en": "1) Best Partners  \nAkitsu was transferred to the East Kantou systems department a month ago. The sales person, Harada, dragged him to see the client together to rectify a problem. He got nervous and fainted.* Harada took care of him, but was still a devil at work. Akitsu became fond of Harada gradually. He got upset and fainted again when he found out that Harada went to a goukon. He confessed to Harada when he woke up to find Harada came back for him in the office. Would Harada accept him?  \n  \n*It seems like he has asthmatic attacks and faints as a result.  \n  \n2) Saying Love After Work (Initial)  \nSequel to chapter 1.  \nAkitsu and Harada are now in a relationship, but since that one night nothing has happened. They have yet to even go on a date because work is keeping Harada busy. Tension builds when, along with the cancelled dates, Akitsu's senior from the head office transfers to their branch for a month.  \n  \n3) Saying Love After Work (Final)  \nPart two of chapter 2.  \nAkitsu suddenly snaps from constantly being stood up by Harada and refuses to listen to anything Harada has to say, and Nakamoto's moving in?! What will Harada do… or does he not really care either way?  \n  \n4) Uniform Bonding  \nAkira and Masashi are best friends, but Masashi is graduating in a week. Akira fell in love with him at first sight and has been in love with Masashi for 10 long years. They end up switching school uniforms because Akira's pants are longer… but when Akira gets home with Masashi's uniform he gets aroused from the smell… and then Masashi walks in?!  \n  \n5) Come Back Again  \nShinya and Tomo were friends since pre-school, but Shinya suddenly decided to go to a boarding high school without saying anything to Tomo. Five years later, they meet up when Shinya stops a pickpocket that stole something from the store Tomo is working at.  \n  \n6) Saying Love After Work ~After That  \nExtra for first couple."
