   "en": "Kazuyoshi Yukawa is a girl in the 6th grade of elementary school. On the way to Mach's grave to offer Chakin Sushi, the favorite food of his beloved dog Mach, who passed away in a traffic accident, Taichi Ban, a childhood friend but a bully, is on his way . He saves a mysterious bipedal \"wombat\" that is about 1 meter tall and is being bullied by his friends.

In front of the Mach grave, where Chakin Sushi was offered, Kazuyoshi was seen crying out of loneliness while eating Chakin Sushi, and was seen from the heavens with a vision of the lower world. Mach was too worried to reach Buddhahood.\n\nOne day, the \"Mach'', unable to see Kazuyoshi being bullied by Taichi and his friends, is allowed to temporarily return to the lower world. \"Mach\" descends to the lower world and tries to help Kazuyoshi, but suddenly that mysterious wombat, calling itself \"Mach Mask\", appears in front of Kazuyoshi, Taichi and the others, and punishes Taichi and the others. As Kazuyoshi breaks down in tears remembering the Mach, Wombat calls himself ``Mach'' and leaves, but what is left behind is the real Mach, who is stunned when he loses the timing to appear in front of Kazuyoshi. \"Met.\n\nThe wombat \"Mach II\" often appears in front of Kazuyoshi and finds meaning in pretending to be Mach and soothing Kazuyoshi's heart. \"Mach\", a dog who cannot attain Buddhahood, continues to watch over from the shadows, never meeting him once, and decreasing the amount of time he can remain in the lower world. In the spring, Kazuyoshi and Taichi become middle school students, and while they clash and worry about each other, they are watched over by everyone and gradually become adults..."
