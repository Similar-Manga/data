   "en": "Photographer Takeshi Kusaka, who was filming the Japan Women's Open on the professional golf tour, was fired from his newspaper company after receiving a protest from the Women's Professional Association due to a slight dispute with female professional golfer Moe Hinata while he was playing. Afterwards, Takeru reunites with Moe without stopping. Takenouchi, a professional golfer who persistently gets involved with Moe, tells him that he is Moe's lover and drives him away, but based on what he said at that time, he is given an outrageous condition: ``Become a professional golfer within two years and win a championship within one year after that.'' It ends up as Takeshi's challenge, which puts a man's pride and will at stake, has begun!"
