   "en": "It has been five years since her ex-boyfriend, with whom she had an in-house relationship, dumped her because of her insensitivity. Riko (32 years old) finds herself immersed in her work, and her boyfriend-less streak is on the rise. One day, at a company drinking party, her ex-boyfriend, the source of her trauma, accuses her of being delicately rude. She is hurt, but Hazuki, a business partner and college classmate, quickly comes to her defense. However, it seems that Hazuki has the same sexual problems as Riko. He asked her, \"Will we solve each other's problems together now?\" \nWhen he says this without any sense of distance, she can't stop her heart from pounding...he even asks her to be his fake girlfriend. Will this confused girl in her twilight years be able to overcome her complex and find happiness?"
