However, on his way to the club, he is caught up in Ultra's wild behavior and realizes that the team doesn't even practice. Frustrated, Kinta challenges Ultra to a match in order to train together, but is defeated by Ultra's swimming ability. Kinta is at a loss, but he learns that the swimming club's activities have only been suspended, and all the members have a strong passion for swimming. At that moment, Ultra, who had seen through Kinta's qualities, invites him with a promise: \"Let's go to the Olympics together.\""
