   "en": "Collection of short stories:  \n  \n1. Kimi to, Sekai ga Owaru Made  \nThe last email I received from Takashi was blank. I have been constantly wondering what the meaning of the blank email was that you sent to me when you were seriously injured in the accident…  \nThe day that Natsume first met Takashi was on a summer like hot day.

Natsu Oto  \n  \n3. Kareshi na Kanojo  \n  \n4. Yuki Machi no Koi  \nTen years ago, Mayuki made a promise to Shuu that they would become lovers if it snows on Christmas Eve and since then she has been waiting patiently. Shuu on the other hand seems to have already forgotten about that promise…?"
