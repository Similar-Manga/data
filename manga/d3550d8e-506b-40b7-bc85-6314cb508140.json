A tale of the rise and fall of a society farm animals form after they overthrow their owner.\n\nAnimals toil and suffer on Manor Farm, owned by the cruel and careless Mr. Jones. One night, Old Major, an elder pig on the farm, has a fantastic dream one night, of which he informs all the other animals; one where animals overthrow the human race, and the fruits of their labor are made theirs to keep. Though he dies not long after, the animals are emboldened with his vivid visions of a potential future - and one day, through a fierce uprising, they take ownership of the farm from Mr. Jones.\n\nManor Farm - now renamed Animal Farm - maintains itself under an ideology known as Animalism, built upon Old Major's dream and stances regarding humans. However, tension is high, and different parties have their own intentions about the fate of Animal Farm..."

     "en": "**Eric Arthur Blair** (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), better known by his pen name **George Orwell**, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. His work is characterised by lucid prose, social criticism, opposition to totalitarianism, and support of democratic socialism.\n\nOrwell produced literary criticism, poetry, fiction and polemical journalism. He is known for the allegorical novella **Animal Farm** (1945) and the dystopian novel **Nineteen Eighty-Four** (1949). \n\nHis non-fiction works, including **The Road to Wigan Pier** (1937), documenting his experience of working-class life in the industrial north of England, and **Homage to Catalonia** (1938), an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), are as critically respected as his essays on politics, literature, language and culture.

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
