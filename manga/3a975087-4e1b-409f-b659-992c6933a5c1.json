   "en": "The imperfect special effects circuit, it is the circuit in the back of the chest of those who can not see \"Heisei special effects\"! Originally, a person who had a complete special effects circuit and watched it as if he was bathed in \"Showa special effects\" was remodeled into an incomplete special effects circuit by an evil organization! Me and you! When I watch \"Heisei no Tokusatsu\", I hear the sound of a whistle out of nowhere, giving me a severe headache and changing the channel. This story is a record of the battle of a man suffering from an imperfect special effects circuit and overcoming it by watching \"Kamen Rider Hibiki\"! The three stories published in the e-book \"Matsudo Angler Corps\" Volume 3 Volume 4 Volume 5 are summarized in one volume and distributed separately for easy reading! I was able to watch from V3 to X and from X to Amazon, but why can't I watch from \"Hibiki\" to \"Kabuto\"? The \"imperfect special effects circuit\" that approaches the core of the problems of modern people's minds! Please take a look!"
