However, for Loren who had no acquaintances and empty pockets, receiving a single quest seemed like a faraway aim. So, as he was contemplating about what he should do next, another adventurer called out to him.\n___\n**Character Designer:** [peroshi](https://mangadex.org/author/18c02af4-21c4-4b2a-a75a-6f0c5ee3d172/peroshi)"

     "en": "**Name In Native Language:** まいん\n\n**Other Romanizations:**\nMINE\nmine\n\n**Controversy:**\nAfter the anime announcement for *Second Life in Another World*, Mine and his flagship series came under criticism. Based on multiple pieces of evidence, people determined that the protagonist of the series likely committed war crimes during World War II (only to then get to enjoy a second life in another world after dying at 94, unpunished). Additionally, they surfaced several past tweets from Mine from 2013 to 2015 that contained insulting and racist statements about China and South Korea.\n\nMine [apologized on Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20180605220213/https://twitter.com/mine_time2010/status/1003939970925486080), deleted all of his tweets, removed his work from Narou (including his other, *Broke Mercenary* series), and said that he would talk with his publisher about revising the printed books.\n\nThe following day, after multiple voice actors resigned from the project, the *Second Life in Another World* anime was cancelled, as later was its light novel series, tho its manga was only put on hiatus, a hiatus it would return from months later to continue for a few years more.\n\nAs for *The Strange Fantasy Story Of A Broke Mercenary*, its light novel was also later cancelled, its Volume 16 never to be released. However, its manga remains ongoing.\n___\n[Former Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/mine_time2010)"
