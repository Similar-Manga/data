   "en": "\"You idiot, cars are our lives!!\" A complete reprint of the passionate story of Goro Inazuma, a brawling but compassionate \"Inazuma Guy\" who puts his dreams and life on the line for racing!! \"Helmet\" is included in a book for the first time!! Commentary Goro and his friends aim to win the car race. They have big ambitions but no track record, so they have difficulty finding sponsors... \"Inazuma Yaro'', which has been serialized in \"Weekly Shonen King'' since 1968, is a hot-blooded racer manga by the well-known racing manga hero Hisashi Sekiya. There are two highlights in this work. One is the story of the main character, Goro Inazuma, who shows lightning-like speed on the circuit , two of his best friends who are mechanics, a sarcastic rival, a respected champion, and other colorful characters, as well as each person's way of life. The other thing is the “car” that is depicted throughout the story. The sight of a race car racing as if it were alive, hurt, and entering the finish line is undeniably the main character behind this work. This is a depiction typical of Hisashi Sekiya, who commented, \" Just by looking at the car, you can feel the life of the car.'' In this reprint, we have added 60 pages of episodes that were not included in the previously published books, making it a complete edition, and we have also included the one-shot work ``Two Helmets'' at the same time. We bring you a book where you can fully enjoy Hisashi Sekiya's race manga!"
