   "en": "Had she found her identity or her destiny?  \n  \nRebel had been fortunate to be adopted-by the James family. The Australian clan fully supported her search for her mother's roots–even though it took her to England.  \n  \nBut when Rebel arrived at Davenport Hall, the English manor where her mother had stayed as a five-year-old war orphan, she was surprised to discover the earl actually seemed to be expecting her.  \n  \nHugh Davenport was not what Rebel had imagined–he was far too handsome and sexy. And Rebel, Hugh discovered, was not the new nanny after all. But none of that mattered. Rebel knew Hugh and his fiery little niece needed her. She'd stay because she had already opened her heart–she needed them too!"
