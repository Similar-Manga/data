   "en": "Tezuka's adaptation of Journey to the West, with a focus on Son Goku.\n\nTwo thousand years ago, a monkey with golden hair was born from a stone on the summit of Mt. Ka-Ka in China. A brave ape, he made himself an apprentice to a sage, and mastered the 72 Earthly Transformations under him. He barges into Tengoku, and stormed into the presence of the Tenno. For his unruly conduct, he was jailed.\n\nSeveral decades later, a Buddhist priest named Sanzo stumbles across Goku's cage. He gives him the name ''Son Goku\", and decides that he will travel with him to India to receive a valuable Buddhist bible.\n\n---\n**Volumes 12-19 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
