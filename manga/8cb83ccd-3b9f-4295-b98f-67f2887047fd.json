   "en": "Collection of short stories:  \n  \n- Yume ni Tobu Tori (A Bird in a Dream)  \nOn Yuuga's birthday, after a huge fight, Soichiro suffers a heart attack–then he's hit by a car. But Soichiro gets a second chance when he wakes up two days before his accident….  \n  \n- Iku Michi, Yobu Tsuki   \nOtsuji cuts through a dangerous park one night. He's attacked by hoodlums and thrown into a lake. There he meets the demon of the lake–and can't leave.  \n  \n- Moment   \nAtsushi slowly recovers after being dumped by his ex-lover. His sister and brother-in-law, worried he's becoming a recluse, invite him out for a drink at their bar. While at the bar he is smitten by Kizaki, a beautiful college student. Before he approaches his crush, Atsushi gets a makeover from his sister (his fashion sense is deplorable). Things go much better than he expected. But, after their tryst, Atsushi has to work overtime for a week. When he finally makes it back to the bar, he sees Kizaki kissing someone else. Will Atsushi be forced to give up on his dream of love?   \n  \n- Hana mo Arashi mo  \nThe florist Nagasaki Kouta is 25 years old, but has the body of a child. He has known the 10 year younger Nagira Takerou since \"Ta-kun\" was a small child who always clung to him; but now the 15 year old boy always insults him and treats him harshly. What has happened to make Ta-kun dislike him so much?  \n  \n- Mayonaka Taiyou (Midnight Sun)   \nKakeru, Shouichi-san, and little Rurika are back in a sequel to Hohoemi no Nichijou. The unexpected visit of the sister of Shouichi's deceased wife convinces Kakeru that he's only a bother to the Konomi household. Will Shouichi (and Ruri) allow him to just leave their family?"
