   "en": "Keio University School of Medicine Associate Professor Hayato Shindo is a talented surgeon who is called \"God's hand\" in the world of esophageal cancer. With the backing of his father, Genichiro, the president of the Tokyo Medical Association, he was in a position to aim for the position of the youngest professor in the history of Keio University. However, Hayato is confronted by the dull “permanent lecturer” Shingo Kurusu. Kurusu says. \"You are a god of death who drives patients to death...\" Continuing, he provokes, \"There's no point in your surgery, why don't you try surgery on me?\" An impatient Hayato puts his pride of \"God's hand\" on the line and confronts Kurusu, who denies cancer surgery...!?\n\nAn unprecedented doctor story that completely denies medical comics and dramas so far begins! ! Cancer surgery and anticancer drugs shorten life expectancy! ? What is the fear of delirium where the personality changes suddenly due to long-term hospitalization? ? Lymph node dissection, which accompanies cancer surgery, is meaningless!? ・・・・・・ etc., the contents are varied. Please take a look!!"
