   "en": "Masaki Tsuji, who has written scenarios for numerous animation works such as \"Astro Boy,\" \"Star of the Titans,\" and \"Devilman,\" and Ken Ishikawa, who breathed new life into robot manga with \"Getter Robo,\" depict the conflict between God and the devil. \"Seimaden'' takes on the challenge of an epic story. Ken Ishikawa, who was in charge of the animation, said that he worked on the project thinking, \"I was so influenced by \"Devilman'' that it gave me goosebumps, and I wanted to draw something like that.'' 15 years have passed since the disappearance of the Son of Santa carrying the Tojo University Exploration Club. Teresa Oma and Yunk Oma, the two siblings born to Asako Oma, the only survivor, became a hot topic in the neighborhood for their beautiful appearance and the huge physique of their younger brother who was in contrast to their older sister. One day, on their way to school, the two are hit by the president's son driving around in a flashy foreign car, and are carried unconscious to an empty warehouse on the outskirts of town."
