   "en": "Seoul these days. Guja is 92 years old. During her retirement life, one day, she and a friend spoke about the government's program to allow Korean families separated by the war in 1950 to meet again. Then, at that moment, her past, her youth, her first marriage, her first two children. And most importantly, this exodus that will separate her from her husband and first son while she's alone with her infant. She'll never see them again. At the twilight of her life, she tells her daughter Jina, a cartoonist for youth, this broken life, these moments of despair, and her life after all of these tragic incidents.",
   "fr": "Séoul, de nos jours. Guja a 92 ans. Sa vie de retraitée est bousculée le jour où, parlant avec une amie, elle découvre le programme gouvernemental permettant à des familles coréennes séparées par la guerre en 1950 de se retrouver. Lui revient alors son passé, sa jeunesse, son premier mariage, ses deux premiers enfants. Et surtout, cet exode qui va la séparer de son mari et de son premier fils alors qu'elle reste seule avec son nourrisson. Jamais plus elle ne les reverra. Au crépuscule de sa vie, elle raconte à sa fille Jina, dessinatrice pour la jeunesse, cette vie brisée, ces moments de désespoir, sa vie d'après."
