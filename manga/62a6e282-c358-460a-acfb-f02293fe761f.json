   "en": "Getting a girlfriend, it's just about the most important thing to a guy when he enters High school. For a fortunate few, all they need to do is look to their right at the familiar face that has always been there smiling and caring. But sadly this isn't the case for our protagonists Meguru and Shou. For starters, they're both guys and on top of that, they haven't had a single female friend since primary school.  \n  \nPerhaps it's their friends showing off the spoils of their romantic pursuits. But something snaps between the childhood friends and each claims they would both be better off if the other was a girl. Though the boys have should have known that you should always be careful of what you wish for. Because that very night, Meguru discovers that he has been turned into a girl! But then, on their first day of school, the two finds themselves surrounded by cute girls. Are the boys regretting what happened? Is this the start of some sort of love triangle? line? cube? some other kind of shape with \"love\" prepended to it? Or, since Meguru is now a girl, perhaps just a harem for Shou?  \n  \nEither ways, hilarity is guaranteed as Meguru tries his best to adapt to his new life as a girl with his new found friends who are all too oblivious to his condition and too eager to help him get used to his life as a \"her\"."
