   "en": "The 9th Shogakukan Manga Award winning work, the timeless masterpiece “Stop! \"Nii-chan The masterpiece that won the Shogakukan Manga Award along with \"Stop! Nii-chan'' has been made into a book for the first time! You can't talk about Hisashi Sekiya without reading this work! \n\nSynopsis: Daisaku Kagami, a new teacher at a small elementary school on a small island, is a kind-hearted yet strong Superman. All of his students call him Fight Sensei because of his habit of saying \"Fight!\" One day during recess, Kagami notices students playing baseball with sticks and stones and warns them that it is dangerous, but he remembers how poor the school is, where they can't afford even science materials, and warns them sternly. He can't do it. Feeling sorry for himself, Kagami plans to buy baseball equipment with the money he gets from selling his singing glove, which is full of his memories, but...\n\nDescription: This work, which was serialized in Shogakukan's school year magazine for about two years starting in 1961, is about Kagami, a new teacher who has been assigned to an elementary school on an isolated island, and the struggle of the students who are injected with a fighting spirit into Kagami. It's a story about growing up. Kajo, like Superman, solves a series of problems such as poor school management, a murderer hiding on the island, and people in the city who threaten the island's beautiful nature. I'm sure there are many Sekiya fans who like Yuichi Nango, the main character of \"Hi-chan'', as an adult. When it comes to school dramas, people tend to think of him as \"hot-blooded,'' but this work is written in a light and fun way, and you'll be able to get a feel for Hisashi Sekiya's true character. We hope you enjoy this masterpiece, which is no wonder why it won the Shogakukan Manga Award."
