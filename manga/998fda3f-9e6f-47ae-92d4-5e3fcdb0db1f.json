   "en": "Imari Daisaku was once an acclaimed filmmaker, but is now at a low point. One day,\nhe receives a doll named 'I.L' with the ability to shift into whatever its master desires. Imari decides to start a business of providing \nstand-ins. Some are for the shameless desires of others, others are for solving mysteries. There are even those who wish for I.L to bust conspiracies.  Whatever it may be, I.L never wears the same face.\n\n---\n**Volumes 262 and 263 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
