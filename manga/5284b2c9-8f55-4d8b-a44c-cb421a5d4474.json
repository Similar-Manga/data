Hence, she is still a virgin. But this time is different. Things are going well with her boyfriend, Akira-kun, and she thought that today was the day he would give her her first kiss...! That's what she thought. But for some reason. Again. As she thought...Chie was dumped just before she turned 30 years old. \nIn front of the stunned Chie, a beautiful man named Takaya Kudo appears, as if riding on a white horse. Chie enjoys talking with Kudo, who says he runs a company, and her shock at being dumped is completely healed. Moreover, when they part ways, Kudo tells Chie that he wants her to meet him again on the premise of a serious relationship. He is handsome, kind, and the president of the company. Wisdom is completely elated, but Kudo has a terrible secret..."
