   "en": "Baku Taiga, a super rookie who can strike out with just one fastball. He has won seven games in the first month of competition in a head-to-head battle of power, and was greeted with applause and calls of ``Tiger'' at his opponent's venue, Tokyo Dome. However, he continued to ignore the signs and was reprimanded by the manager, so he got angry and walked off the mound without permission. However, he was accidentally hit in the head by an unknown player who was practicing swinging behind the bench, and the next thing he knew, he was in Korakuen Stadium, not the Dome. The date on the newspaper is 1962, and the legendary \"ON\" is in the batter's box...!?"
