   "en": "Nagai's ecchi parody of Superman, more so the 1978 film starring Christopher Reeve.\n\nFrom the planet Peetan (Century egg) in the Zha Cai (pickled mustard plant) Nebula, tens of billions of years away from Earth, comes the amazing Superman, Chou Man! He usually works part-time at a ramen shop, but his powers are stronger than any superhero, he can even leap over the Tokyo Tower in a single bound! To protect only justice, truth, and beautiful women, Cho-Man fights day and night, without regard for the troubles he causes around him!"

Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
