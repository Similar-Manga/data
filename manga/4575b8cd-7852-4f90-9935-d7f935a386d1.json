   "en": "Kato Hayabusa Combat Team, Advance!!\n\nA comic about aviation warfare in which a young airman led by the shoot-down king,\nLt. Col. Takeo Kato, flies the famous Hayabusa aircraft!A long-awaited reprint!!\n\nSynopsis:\nFlying like the wind in the sky, the majestic figure of the Hayabusa fighter jet!!\nIppei Hayabusa is a boy who seems to have been born to ride a Falcon.\nThe “Kato Hayabusa Combat Team”, who have been honing their skills under the esteemed Captain Kato, are ordered to go to the Malay Peninsula! The\nKato Hayabusa Combat Team is dispatched!!\n\nDescription\nThe main character, Ippei Hayabusa, belongs to the \"Kato Hayabusa Combat Team\" led by Lieutenant Colonel Takeo Kato, who is known as the shooting down king.\nHe grows up without being defeated by the deaths of his comrades and commanders on the battlefield where bullets fly.\n\"Oozora no Chikai'', which has been serialized in ``Shonen Sunday'' since 1962,\nis a war story manga by Ippei Kuri, who made the racer manga \"Mach Sanshiro'' a big hit in \"Shonen Magazine'' the previous year. This work especially depicts the\nmain character Ippei's attachment to his beloved aircraft, the Hayabusa, and the scenes in which Ippei sometimes rides enemy tanks and fighter planes in all directions. This is similar to the relationship between the main character and the motorcycle in his previous work \"Mach Sanshiro'', and Ippei Kuri differentiates \"Oozora no Chikai'' from other war story manga by drawing it not just as a war story manga, but also as a vehicle manga that he specializes in. It is presumed that he was trying to make a difference. In this reprint, we have recorded all the stories and made it a [complete version]. As a side note, many people may be familiar with the \"Kato Hayabusa Combat Team'' as it is a famous unit that has been featured in movies and military songs. In particular, the military song \"Kato Hayabusa Sentai\", which is mentioned in the main story, is a famous song that can be sung at karaoke."
