   "en": "(from wikipedia.jp):\nA series of one-shots adapted from the author's debut work \"Spring Blooming Happening\". It was serialized intermittently in the supplemental editions of \"LaLa\" in parallel with \"Dissonance Rhapsody\" (1982-84) and \"Moon is East, Sun is West\" (1985-86), which were serialized in the main issue of \"LaLa\" and took five years to complete. \n\nSet in an apartment in a provincial city that appears to be the United States, the story depicts a young man's search for family relationship building and self-realization.\n\nCharacters from \"Dogs Week\" (published in the November 1981 issue of LaLa and included in the first volume of the book), the author's contribution (winner of the 35th LaLa Manga School Runner-up Top Prize) and first work published in a magazine, also appear in the series."
