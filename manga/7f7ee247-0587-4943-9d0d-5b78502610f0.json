   "en": "Kuro-chan, the shadow master who is Shiro-chan's alter ego, is a reliable person who appears when called to help the weak. Today, my husband Shiro-chan and I are working hard to help those in need! Also included is \"Gokuro-san,'' in which the main character with outstanding athletic ability unfolds a school drama full of laughter and tears with sportsmanship in mind! A continuation of his masterpieces \"Sportsman Kintaro'' and \"Uniform Number 0''. Please enjoy the roots of the author, who is full of kindness towards others. This book, \"Black and White Monogatari,'' is the serialized debut work of Hiroo Terada, who is known by the nickname Tera-san to manga fans and was a leader of Tokiwa-sou. The magazine in which it appears is Manga Shonen, published by Gakudosha, which Terada himself called his \"ideal magazine.'' Terada, who moved to Tokyo in 1953 with the aim of becoming a manga artist, was selected to be featured in the magazine's \"Manga Tsuushinbo'' column, which was a gateway to success in the manga world. Two years later, this work was serialized from the April issue of 1955 to the October issue, but due to the bankruptcy of Gakudosha, the November issue was not published, making the work virtually unfinished. The review structure of \"Manga Tsuushinbo'' continues even during its serialization, and many manga artists such as Shotaro Ishinomori, Kazuo Umezu, Fujiko Fujio, Shinichi Suzuki, and Fujio Akatsuka have left the company."
