   "en": "Some may consider the Tachibana family as a strange family. First of all, the four sisters and brother were born of different fathers. Their characters were completely opposite too… Momo, the eldest of the four, considered herself a successful ‘wonder woman’ who was perfect in domestic household as well as office administration. The only problem was, she just wanted to get marry, to anyone willing! Kiku, the second daughter of the family, was a casual university art student and had a hairdresser boyfriend called Tokiwa, whom despite of his cool look, was always feeling insecure about their relationship. Ume, the third Tachibana daughter, was a high school student aiming to enter medicine school, hence the most demanding one in the family. Ume hardly paid attention to her weight and appearances until one day, Koizumi, the college ‘hot shot’ asked her out! Little did she know that, she was actually natural plump beauty, especially when she took down her glasses… And finally Ranmaru, the little brother in the family. Though the youngest, he was hardly a spoiled child. Quite on the contrary, Ranmaru was rather disturbed and dramatised by all those love and romances happening in his family, especially since their mother was about to marry again, despite her previous four divorces…!\n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/0nx35ii/go-go-girls"
