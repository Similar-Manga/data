   "en": "Hae-Gyeong has a horrible dream in which he meets a terrible group who are killing him saying; \"'Boss star' Hae-Deung, the head of Hyeon-Mu! We are here receive your life. Only the universe may know what will be there at the end of this way! Anyhow, you have to die here and now!\"  \n  \nAt the offset, it seems that Hae-Gyeong is a very ordinary highschool boy. However, the truth is murkier than even he himself knows… Originally Hae-Gyeong was Hae-Deung, King Hyeon-Mu, in the fantasy world, but his power had been sealed through the veiled enmity caused by his entanglement in the Daegyeolgye causing him to be born into the present world.  \n  \nHae-Gyeong is shocked and disbelieving when he hears about this truth from his best friend, Wun-Hak. What is worse, Kin Ju-Jak, suddenly appears and attacks Hae-Gyeong, who has not yet awakened, and he is narrowly rescued by Kin Cheong-Ryong who claims to be his ally.  \n  \nAs he gains a better understanding of his previous life, Hae-Gyeong awakens his powers gradually. How is it going to end?"
