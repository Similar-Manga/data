   "en": "Shunya’s office is buzzing with wild rumors. Vice President Yuusei Saotome, son of the President and heir to the company, is missing! Most believe he ran off to escape an arranged marriage that would benefit his father’s company. Only Shunya knows that the VP has amnesia and is staying with him in his apartment. The Yuu that Shunya knows is not the coldly handsome VP who barely noticed his underlings. This Yuu is easygoing and likes to cook for Shunya. Yuu even seems to want Shunya in his arms as much as Shunya wants to be there. For a while, Shunya lives in a dream with Yuu. But doubts nag at his conscience. What if Yuu has another love who is searching for him? What will happen when his memory returns? Would Shunya be forgotten or hated by Yuu?\n\n- Himitsu no Koibito Sengen (The Lover's Secret)\nWhen Natsuki's parents go overseas, he is sent to live with a distant relative, a handsome man who treats him like a maid, yet calls him \"first-class goods\" and says he is going to \"cultivate\" him. What is Natsuki to think about Tomoki-san's profession, especially after seeing adult videos in his room?\n\nStories included in this volume:\n- Again Tomorrow\n- Private Lesson\n- The Lover's Secret\n- A Promise Time and Time Again (an extra for Again Tomorrow)"
