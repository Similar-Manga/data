   "en": "A certain Famicom event venue. Daichi Minami, a member of the Famicom Boy Scouts, happens to see Meijin Takahashi discussing new software with event staff in the waiting room for those involved.\nIntrigued, Daichi sneaks into Hudson's office and learns that the new software is actually a new shooting game that surpasses \" Starforce \", but is soon discovered and suspected of being a corporate spy.\nHowever, as soon as it became clear that Daichi was a member of the Famicom Boy Scouts, the masters dispelled their suspicions in an instant. They were also members of the Famicom Boy Scouts.\nDaichi, who was allowed to attend the production meeting as a user representative, provided various ideas for the new software from the player's point of view, and shook the master with his imagination.\nThe incident happened right after Daichi and Meijin left the company after finishing the meeting. Someone on a motorcycle attacked and injured the master's right hand.\nWith the help of Goujiichi, who happened to appear on the spot, he managed to successfully repel the enemy, but in this state, Meijin cannot test play the game, which hinders software development.\nAs a result of the master's recommendation and test, both Daichi and Hajime were selected as substitute players during the treatment, but what jumped in there was the disclosure of the secret of the game published by those who called themselves the Famicom Boy Scouts. It was a book report.\nActions that deprive the enjoyment of the game are unacceptable. Daichi's first job as a member of the Famicom Boy Scouts has begun."
