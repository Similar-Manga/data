   "en": "Orphaned on the mean streets of Treasure Town, lost boys Black and White must mug, steal and fight to survive. Around them moves a world of corruption and loneliness, small-time crooks and neurotic police officers, and a band of sadistic yakuza who have plans for their once-fair city. Can they rise above their environment? Surreal manga influenced by European comics.",
   "pt-br": "Numa cidade de “ferro” e “concreto” (significado em japonês de Tekkon Kinkreet), vivem personagens também implacáveis e indomáveis. Kuro (o Preto) e Shiro (o Branco) são órfãos. Para sobreviver, eles têm de roubar, lutar e se esconder em um mundo sombrio, solitário e corrupto, onde a própria cidade os afaga ou os despreza, como se fosse um ser vivo. O soberbo desenho de Matsumoto, rico em pequenos detalhes, traduz fielmente o ambiente desta história que pode se tornar angustiante, mas que ao mesmo tempo nos emociona e nos liberta."
