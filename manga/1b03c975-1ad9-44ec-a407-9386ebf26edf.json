     "en": "Masashi Kishimoto (岸本 斉史, Kishimoto Masashi, born November 8, 1974) is a Japanese manga artist. His best known work, Naruto, was in serialization from 1999 to 2014 and has sold over 250 million copies worldwide in 46 countries as of May 2019. The series has been adapted into two anime and multiple films, video games, and related media. Besides the Naruto manga, Kishimoto also personally supervised the two canonical anime films, The Last: Naruto the Movie and Boruto: Naruto the Movie, and has written several one-shot stories. In 2019, Kishimoto wrote Samurai 8: The Tale of Hachimaru which ended in March 2020. From May 2016 through October 2020 he supervised the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations manga written by [Ukyō Kodachi](https://mangadex.org/author/54d2c255-f4a9-4bd5-b927-587ef9c4e3d2/kodachi-ukyou) and illustrated by [Mikio Ikemoto](https://mangadex.org/author/99fd0ae9-cac3-47ed-85c9-e9983b93c839/ikemoto-mikio). In November 2020 it was announced that he had taken over as writer on the series, replacing Kodachi.\n\nA reader of manga from a young age, Kishimoto showed a desire to write his own manga, citing authors [Akira Toriyama](https://mangadex.org/author/7bb20b16-0f35-4510-b2b3-bbeffba54c23/toriyama-akira) and [Katsuhiro Otomo](https://mangadex.org/author/42390fa3-1ff3-4ca9-871a-2133783a28a1/otomo-katsuhiro) as his main inspirations. As a result, Kishimoto spent several years working to write his own shōnen manga for Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine which he was a fan of."
