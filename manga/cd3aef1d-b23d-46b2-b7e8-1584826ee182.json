Bradherley, uno de los aristócratas más importantes de Europa, envía a su carruaje a varios orfanatos para que adopte a jovencitas y las entrene para formar parte de su compañía de ópera. Pero la mayoría de estas chicas nunca llegan a subir al escenario: les aguarda un destino mucho más siniestro, sacrificadas en nombre de un bien mayor."
