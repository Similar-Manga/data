   "en": "\"I need your help, Doctor.\"\nDo Won, a psychoanalyst well-known in the United States, returns to Korea, where he works as a counselor for a research institution affiliated with a governmental agency. One day, he meets with an arsonist, who is infamously known for not leaving behind traces of his crimes. \n\"I want you to give me psychological counseling. The period of treatment will last until I’m completely healed.\"\n\"I have one condition. Do not be suspicious of me, and do not try to sound me out.\"\n\"Is there any way for me to get you to listen to me without the need for threats, Doctor?\" \n\"You can just ask me politely.\"\n\"Ask politely…\"\n\nThe man is MJ, who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and is unable to control his urge to set things on fire. This man seeks the help of Do Won to cure him of his illness, and the latter eventually agrees to help in this mysterious and dangerous counseling. It was only later on, however, that Do Won finds out that this man, whom he thought was just an ordinary arsonist, was actually related to a \"major incident\", and Do Won unexpectedly gets involved in a case with \"Father\"...\n\"I need you, Doctor. You said you wouldn't give up on your patients. Don't give up on them. See, they need you this much. Hmm?\""
