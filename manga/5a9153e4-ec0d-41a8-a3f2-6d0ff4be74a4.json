   "en": "(from MangaUpdates):\n\nHow about this, a manga for adults – and not young adults either. This is a series of stories about love and romance amongst the older generations. As the manga itself says, “In the later years of their lives, men and women sometimes find themselves in the glow of love. Their love stories are shining like shooting stars in the twilight.”\n\nNote: Won the Excellence Prize in the Manga Division at Japan Media Arts Festival in 2000."
