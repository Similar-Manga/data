   "en": "An incredible high school has made it through to the qualifying rounds and finals to qualify for Koshien in the summer. Midoriyama High School is an all-first year team that was just founded this year. Led by the monster Nikaido, they are a group of people who are full of individuality, or rather, who want to stand out and ignore teamwork. We kept fighting during the match. In the top of the 16th inning, the game was tied 1-1 against Shindo High School, the favorite for the championship, and Nikaido was hit by three runs, but Hanaoka hit a runaway home run in the end to win the game. He decided to participate in Koshien. At Koshien, Nikaido, who was unable to control his game, allowed\n4 points in the first inning, but continued to score 0 points after that."
