   "en": "Bukimi-kun, a boy with psychic powers, Makoto Ishino. Wherever he goes, monsters and ghosts appear here and there. His classmates Yasuhiko, Ichiro, and Yukari are also involved in the dazzling world of occult gags. . One time, he found a treasure 800 years ago, was attacked by a cannibal half-fish man at a camp, soothed the spirit of a daughter who died in a traffic accident, exorcised a war dead who nested in a church, and beautiful twins in a phantom hidden village. He was courted by the Bake Jizo, suffered the curse of Bakejizo, allowed death to become possessed, had his illness reflected by a Bakeneko with leukemia, consulted a wife-killing doctor with two faces, and boiled down a dead old man in the bath. Frightened by an old woman in a detached house, earning the wrath of a snake man enshrined in a shrine, receiving treasures from fairies and korobokkuru, peeking at the game of tag in the underworld, receiving horns and being able to see ghosts, in the Heart Sutra Get rid of the little devil,"
