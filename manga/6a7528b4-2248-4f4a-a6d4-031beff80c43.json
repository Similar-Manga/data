   "en": "The super scientific genie has arrived!!\nWhat is the purpose of the Prince of Paron and his guardian deity Bandar,\nwho came from the distant planet of Mercury?\n\nEach volume includes complete reading works!!\n\n[Synopsis] One day, three capsules fall to Earth. The capsule contained two aliens and a monster... The government thinks that aliens have come to attack Earth with monsters, and orders the police and Self-Defense Forces to attack!\n\n[Commentary] \"Mashin Bander'' is a special effects work produced during the monster/special effects boom that swept TV and movies from the 1960s. The manga version was written by Satoshi Inoue, who worked as chief assistant under Osamu Tezuka, and began serialization in Akita Shoten's \"Boukenou'' in 1966. Originally, the drama was supposed to be broadcast at the same time, but due to various circumstances, the broadcast was postponed and was not aired until 1969.\nIn the same era, there were also hits with giant robots such as \"Gigantor' and ``Giant Robo'', which made it extremely popular. In particular, the scene in which Bander's calm face disappears when he gets angry and is replaced by a ferocious face is a scene that is burned into the hearts of viewers. This time, it includes episodes and one-shots from the \"Adventurer King\" series. We hope you will enjoy to your heart's content one of the works that was responsible for the monster/special effects boom."
