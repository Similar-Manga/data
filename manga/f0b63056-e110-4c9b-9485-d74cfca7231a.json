   "en": "This is the first reprint of the popular boy swordsman hero manga that was serialized in the May to December issues of the boys' magazine Hinomaru (Shueisha) in 1959. Gennosuke, a ronin, was murdered at the hands of a samurai, and Daisuke, a boy who looked up to him as his mentor, was searching for his true identity. Daisuke disguises himself as a Kurenai swordsman and fights against evil in order to avenge his master's death by defeating a group of thieves that are causing trouble in the city. Daisuke suffers in front of his strong enemy, Sakon. Will he be able to master the deadly sword Konoha Gaeshi and defeat the great evil? This eye-catching masked hero period drama, which is still popular among a wide range of generations and features brilliant storytelling by the great master Mitsuteru Yokoyama, is being reprinted for the first time in half a century. This is a hidden masterpiece by an author whose career and number of works rivals that of Osamu Tezuka."
