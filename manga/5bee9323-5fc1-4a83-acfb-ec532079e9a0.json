     "en": "Taiyō Matsumoto (Japanese: 松本 大洋, Hepburn: Matsumoto Taiyō, born October 25, 1967) is a Japanese manga artist from Tokyo. He has won several awards, including the Shogakukan Manga Award, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and Eisner Award.\n\nMatsumoto originally wanted to be a soccer player, but changed to artist as an occupation instead. After his initial success in the Comic Open contest, he began touring France in 1986, an event that became a significant point in his career. The manga he produced covers a variety of topics, from sports to family comedies to science fiction epics.\n\nIn 1993, he began work on the [Tekkonkinkreet](https://mangadex.org/title/7661932f-7f80-4c3a-bb37-6861a1477876/tekkon-kinkreet) manga, which became a success in the Big Spirits magazine, and published a series of short stories in a collection called Nihon no Kyodai that was publicized at the time by Comic Aré magazine. [Ping Pong](https://mangadex.org/title/7e435a27-b4fc-417d-94de-30cea79ab6f4/ping-pong) appeared in Big Spirits in 1996, soon followed by the series No. 5 in Shogakukan's Monthly Ikki magazine in 2000.\n\nThe Tekkonkinkreet anime was released in Japan in late 2006, and both the anime and manga have been published in English.",
