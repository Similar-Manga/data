   "en": "Nakano Fudanshi Gakuen is a school renowned for its sports program, yet only has an average school rating of 50! Within the school, there is a club on the verge of losing its official status called \"Fudanjuku\". The club's theme is, to put it simply, \"anything-goes\". This story is a slapstick school comedy revolving around the unique seven members and their various troubles."
