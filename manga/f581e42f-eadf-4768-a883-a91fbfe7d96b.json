   "en": "・Manga stories, pictures, etc. are all things that will make even adults smile. The rounded designs, including ``Goro-chan,'' are very cute and will be soothing to adults. This is definitely a manga that you can enjoy with your children.\n\n・This work was published in an educational magazine for first graders of elementary school, so 11 stories, each about 4 pages long, are divided into 11 stories so that first graders can read them without getting bored.\n\n・Although the main target audience is first grade elementary school students, this was determined based on the framework of the grade-based study magazine and is not absolute.\n\n・The target age group is thought to be around 4 to 8 years old. The content is also very useful for preparing for elementary school.\n\n・As a sister work, there is a picture book version of Kaminarigoro-chan called ``Pancakes are Falling.'' The target age range for this book is from 0 to 4 years old, so after reading the picture book, you can continue reading the comic version of \"Kaminari Goro-chan\" to your child. Children will be able to have fun with Goro-chan from infancy to early elementary school.\n\n・The content of each story is based on events that first graders experience at elementary schools throughout the year (e.g. sports days, camps, school lunches, etc.). , children will be able to read with interest.\n\n・By reading this manga, you will be able to learn the systematic study of Japanese that you learn in elementary school, such as the structure of the Japanese syllabary system. From this perspective, adults can use this manga to interest and educate children.\n\n・One of the included works, ``Goro-chan Picture Diary,'' is intended to encourage children to develop the habit of keeping a diary, especially during summer vacation.\n\n・The author strives to make the manga itself as enjoyable as possible while taking such educational considerations into account.\n\n・Children can enjoy ``easy learning'' as fun comics are featured throughout the book."
