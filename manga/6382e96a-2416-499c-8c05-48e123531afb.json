   "en": "- I Can Hear the Ghostly Drum-Beating  \nThe first guy Rika ever falls for turns out to be her older sister's fiancé. However, her sister's dream since she was a child was to be a bride, and ever since her engagement to another guy didn't work out a few years earlier due to her not being able to conceive, Rika swore to do everything in her power to help her sister fulfill her dream. Does that include helping her marry the guy that she's in love with?!  \n  \n- Like Snow Falling on Harbor  \nYori runs into Kurita, a girl he knew from basketball club back in high school. Back then, she was a quiet girl who had a quirky oddness to her. When he runs into her out of coincidence two years later, however, he finds that she's become an out-going (if not slightly high-strung) girl. A few weeks after their chance meeting, he receives a phone call from the hospital saying she had tried to kill herself, and he finds out the true reason for the drastic change.  \n  \nIncludes other stories.  \nThis manga won the Shogakukan Manga Award for shoujo in 2000.  \n  \nRelated:  \n- [Osusume Boyfriend](https://mangadex.org/title/f201268f-fdbd-4dd3-9725-d15a56f894ed/osusume-boyfriend) \n(Contains a sequel to \"Like Snow Falling on Harbor\")"
