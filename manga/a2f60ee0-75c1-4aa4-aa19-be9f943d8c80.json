Itou-san  \nNumerous brief comics about the life of a single 28-year old known to readers only as Itou-san, and her day-to-day interactions with a colleague whom she later dates.  \n  \n2. Sensei +  \nAn ordinary 25-year old schoolteacher meets a man who claims he can use magic and who goes on to ask her to return the magic she's borrowed from him, although she has no memory of such a thing. But when she uses magic, she turns into a magical girl instead?!  \n  \n3. Hajimari  \nMasakazu meets his new step-sister for the first time. She's his age, and what's more, she's really cute.

This is a short comic about a tall girl who laments her height. But with her even taller boyfriend now, she wonders if his height is the only reason she's dating him.  \n  \n5. Doukei no Ie  \nAbout a couple living in a ninja mansion. It would be the most awesome house if not for the fact that it is crawling with all sorts of booby traps and secret passageways - a pain to live in. What will come of the quarrel between the two over the decision to buy over and live in the mansion?  \n  \n6. Chocolate Cake  \nWhat does it mean when your husband suddenly buys a chocolate cake home on any other ordinary day?  \n  \n7. Futari no Deai no Hanashi  \nKouhei fondly recalls how his love with Saitou started out - the awkward silences, nervous waiting, embarrassed smiles, and what it all finally led to. Based on a true story.  \n  \n8. Bluff  \nHarada is well known for her big mouth in rattling off all the faults of her seniors in the girls' volleyball club. But is there more than meets the eye? And how will the tension between Harada and the senior girls finally be resolved?"
