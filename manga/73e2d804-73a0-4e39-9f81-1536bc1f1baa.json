   "en": "2016. Andreanov's son Mikhail comes to Japan. He asks Ueno, who is currently the coach of Meikyo Gakuin's gymnastics club, to teach him Shun's \"Fujimaki II'' Stretch Gaylord Single Twist. After testing Mikhail, Ueno tells him, \"If you don't enjoy gymnastics, you can't do Fujimaki II.'' But... Good luck! Hiroyuki Kikuta's first collection of short stories, which includes four extra stories (episodes 1 to 4) and two other one-shots, in addition to the main story of Fly high. The author does his best in the first episode! It is a work that he said was intended to be the real final episode of Flyhigh. ``I wanted the spirit of the city to not end in Sydney, but to be passed on,'' the passion conveyed. Episodes 2 to 4 feature previously untold episodes about familiar characters such as the Three Idiots (Uchida, Higashi, and Sanada) and Coach Misaki. Also included are School★Force, in which the original characters of the Three Idiots appear as a member of the \"Survival Club,\" and Trouble Courier, a love story about a young man working at a transportation company."
