   "en": "Amu-chan, a slightly tomboyish girl who runs around with her braids flowing, is the princess of the Jewel Kingdom. Since she is not a resident of the human world, she can untie her braids and use magic. She gets tired of living in a castle and runs away from home to the human world with her companion rabbit, Mimitaro! A lot of wonderful events were waiting there, but at the same time troubles and accidents occurred one after another. Amu-chan solves cases by using the power of gems in order, such as diamonds in April (conveying eternal love), emeralds in May (for happiness), and pearls in June (for curing illnesses)! She makes memories that shine one by one. However, a violent monster that was banished from the Jewel Kingdom came from the \"Frightening Door\" and caused a great panic. For her first friend, Yume-chan, who is serious and kind, and for all of her classmates, Amu-chan uses her ultimate magic... This is the first volume (2 volumes in total) of a magical jewelry comic that revived a phantom manuscript featuring colorful gems!"
