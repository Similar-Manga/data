   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nEast Africa, 1800s. In a village wiped out by drought, an infant miraculously survives. The child is swallowed by a torrent created by a sudden squall and buried in the mud, but is saved by a passing cowherd. \n\nThe kind-hearted man named the child \"Baccus\" (meaning \"budding thing\"). But the man is killed by a falling rock. Then came a man named Zeus, who had been banished from a village as punishment for meddling with another man's wife. \n\nHe returns to his former village with a number of cows and Baccus that he happened to have in his possession. \n\nThings take an unexpected turn from there..."
