   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nThe family that lives in the ancient castle of \"Full Moon Castle\" are all renowned as true-to-life, bizarre actors. Mycroft is a handsome and talented actor who is rapidly gaining popularity, and is unrivaled when it comes to playing werewolves. Other members of the family were also getting jobs as werewolves, mummies, Frankensteins, and vampires, all of which were so convincing that they could be mistaken for the real thing. In order to improve their performances and for publicity, all of them usually did not wear costumes and never showed their real faces. They refused to give any interviews about their personal lives, and everything was shrouded in mystery. They were real werewolves and mummies, hiding their true identities and hiding in the human world. However, they were so busy with their work that they could no longer run the household, so they finally decided to hire a human to work at the Full Moon Castle. Among the many applicants, the final two remaining were Shirley, a student, and Bella, an unidentified beautiful woman. Who will be hired, Shirley or Bella? And will the inhabitants of Full Moon Castle be able to keep their secret? Also included are masterpiece one-shots \"Dear Brother\", \"A Dangerous Relationship\", and \"The Day Snow Falls\"."
