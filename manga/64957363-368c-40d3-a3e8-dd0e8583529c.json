   "en": "A bad boy, Ryu, who rarely goes home and wanders around the city at night and acts violently against middle-aged people he doesn't know. One day, his girlfriend Ruiko says she will meet a middle-aged man she met on a teleclub, so Ryu heads off to hunt fathers as usual, but the middle-aged man turns out to be his own father. Ryu, who was stunned by the shock, was unable to dodge the truck and got into a traffic accident, and for some reason his soul and cat were switched. As he sees the world from a cat's point of view, he becomes aware of many things, such as the richness of nature and the dismemberment of his family.\nWhat lies beyond wandering...!??"
