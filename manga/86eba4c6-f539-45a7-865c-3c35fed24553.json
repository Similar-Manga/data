   "en": "After foreign assassins killed the Dalai Lama, an attempt was made to find his reincarnation. After 20 years without being able to find the Dalai Lama's reincarnation, the oracle foresaw a location during his meditation. This location turned out to be \"Moo Hyuk\" High School, a high school where the worlds elite were created. Knowing this knowledge, the below par troublemaker monk, Dang because of a mix up was assigned to the crucial task of finding the reincarnated Dalai Lama. However, known to no one except his instructors, the troublemaker Dang possess a hidden ability and this ability is only shown when he is sexually aroused making his chi explode, turning him into a powerful monster! Not knowing this because he had never been sexually aroused during his training as a monk and unbeknownst to him, his instructor tells him that he should stay away from bottled coke shaped women. He is also put in a special class meant for the \"Trash\" and the weak, filled with a bunch of weirdo classmates. Will he be able to accomplish the difficult task of finding the reincarnated Dalai Lama with all of these \"coke bottle shaped\" women around?"
