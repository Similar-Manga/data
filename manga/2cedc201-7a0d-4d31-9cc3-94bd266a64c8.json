   "en": "The main character, Shusaku Ichijo, who aspires to be a strong judoka following his father's feelings, begins the story when he moves to Aoba Gakuen High School, living at the house of Yayoi Uesugi, the heroine of this work, who is the daughter of his father's old friend.\n\nIn the first year of high school, the judo club was established, but he did not participate in the official competition, and was involved in a duel with the school's rogue boxing club, a hostage-taking case of a murder fugitive, and a connection with his father. Confrontation with the ancient Jiu-Jitsu school , episodes of the princess escort of a fictitious country, other-style matches, and episodes of mixed martial arts are mainly drawn.\n\nWhen Shusaku and Yayoi advance to the second year of high school, Yusaku Makihara, who has been newly appointed to the school, will strengthen the judo club. He will challenge the official judo match, and will advance from the regional tournament to the Tokyo tournament and the national tournament, and sharpen his rivals with various rivals."
