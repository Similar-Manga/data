   "en": "Ultra's father, mother, brother... and Taro is here!\nVery popular, Mamoru Uchiyama version of Ultraman = 3rd! The most popular work in the series \"Taro\" is finally here!\n\nUltraman, the immortal hero born in Japan. Mamoru Uchiyama's version of 'Ultraman', which was serialized very popularly by 'second graders' from 1971 to 1974, will be released as a full-scale book for the first time this autumn to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Tsuburaya Productions' Ultraman Series! The third installment is the popular work \"Ultraman Taro\" (1973)! Taro, transformed by ZAT member Taro Higashiko, is very active against scary monsters. This work is the first to draw \"Ultra no Kuni\" and is a monumental masterpiece that greatly fuses the TV series and the dreams of the readers of the school yearbook. Please enjoy the Uchiyama Ultra World, which is getting more and more passionate!\nSmart and elegant character design, speedy development, and the power of dynamic battle scenes are truly unique to Mamoru Uchiyama. On that day, Taro's activities that the boys were heartbroken... are coming back after 38 years!\nThe series, which was praised as \"one of the best masterpieces\" among the many Ultraman comicalized works, was only released as a convenience store comic in the mid-2000s after being published in a magazine (already sold out), and is now difficult to obtain. It became a rare work of \"phantom\", and it was eagerly desired to be published in a cohesive form.\nDirector Shinji Higuchi is also enthusiastic! (=Recommendation comments below) A chance to have four popular masterpieces in our own “reprint request” in an affordable form. Includes the full story of the monthly magazine serialization, including all the cover art from the magazine serialization, a new interview with Mamoru Uchiyama full of creative secrets, and a mini comic \"Time Slip Graffiti My Ultra 1973\" drawn by Mamoru Uchiyama. Stay tuned!!\n\nPublisher: Fukkan.com / Planning Cooperation: Shogakukan (C) Tsuburaya Pro is not recorded this time. Thank you for your understanding."
