   "en": "A mysterious man, Sheen, appears before Yami, an ordinary high school student. The two go back in time. What happened to the twins who were never meant to be born under the fate of an immortal family? Mysterious Romanesque! Now, destiny begins to turn...! A tribe of immortals living in the darkness of the world. They have lived forever by feeding on humans and using them as mothers for new birth. Their absolute chief, Sheen, falls in love with Kayoko, a human who is supposed to be the instrument of his new birth. She too, because of her love for Sheen, refuses to exist as a tool, gives birth to twins as a proof of her love, and dies. Sixteen years later, the family begins working to feed the imperfect Chou to Yami in order to make him whole. However, Sheen hesitates to do so, as if cursing the continuation of his family. Then he is involved in a car accident and disappears in flames..."
