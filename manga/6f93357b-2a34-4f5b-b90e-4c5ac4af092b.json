   "en": "Kiyohara-kun, also known as the \"Bancho\" of the Kianz, will live up to his nickname, after Matsui-kun left for the major leagues, to run the Kianz? Matsui-kun\", Watanabe's owner, Kuwata, and many other teammates also make appearances, and their slapstick style is still alive and well!! I can't wait to see how I'll be greeted!! Professional baseball fans, as well as non-professional baseball fans, are sure to burst out laughing. A super-luxury gag ball feast with all-star appearances!"
