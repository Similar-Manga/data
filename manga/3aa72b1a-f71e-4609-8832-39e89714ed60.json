   "en": "Ranch Sheep is a first-year junior high school student who attends St. Freud Academy. She's a very laid back person, and she'll fall asleep pretty quickly anywhere. She had an excellent twin sister, Utsutsu, who could do anything. But in reality, these two are cousins. The sheep's mother was in a plane crash 13 years ago, and although she miraculously survived, she hasn't regained consciousness since then and has been hospitalized for a long time. The sheep was a child born at the crash site, and she was raised with Utsutsu after the accident. Lately, the sheep has been encountering a strange creature called \"Baku\" in his dreams. She's an imaginary creature from China, and she's faintly familiar with the Baku, which is said to eat nightmares. One day, Utsutsu was kidnapped by a group of four delinquents. Sheep receives an SOS message on her cell phone, but she is overcome by sleepiness and falls asleep. In that sleep, another tapir appeared. Baku \"accesses\" the sheep's consciousness and transforms into a \"sleeper\". Let's go help Depression!!"
