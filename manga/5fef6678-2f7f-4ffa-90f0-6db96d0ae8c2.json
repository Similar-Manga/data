As a reincarnated courtesan, she unravels the mysteries of the Imperial Palace!\n\nNagamine, 28 years old, is a hardworking and poor female office worker whose creed is \"If you don't work, you don't eat. Both work and love have been a bit stagnant lately.\"\n\nOne day, she comes across her boyfriend cheating on her with her best friend.\nWhen she tries to chase after him, she gets hit by a car, and when she wakes up, she finds herself reincarnated in a past world that looks like China!\nRight next to her is a bloodied corpse. Unable to comprehend the situation at all, he is mistaken for the murderer and imprisoned.\n\nHowever, she is rescued by Zhao Zijin, a nephew of the emperor and a military officer.\nFrom the stories of those around her, it seems that Butei has been reincarnated in the body of Nanrin, a courtesan with the same name as herself.\nButei, who has taken up residence in Zijin's mansion, uses her many skills, which were completely useless in her current life, to help Zijin and others around her.\n\nButei's activities caught the emperor's ear, and she was ordered by him to work as a courtesan at the Xianghua Palace!\nAs a backdoor mission, Rin was ordered to spy on the emperor and encountered many strange incidents in the palace. ......?"
