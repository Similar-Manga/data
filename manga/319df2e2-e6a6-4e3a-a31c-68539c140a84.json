   "en": "Winning isn't everything in the game of basketball, but who wants to come in second? It takes dedication and discipline to be the best, and the Shohoku High hoops team wants to be just that. They have one last year to make their captain's dream of reaching the finals come true–will they do it? Takehiko Inoue's legendary beloved basketball manga is finally here and the tale of a lifetime is in your hands.  \n  \nHanamichi Sakuragi's got no game with girls—none at all! It doesn't help that he's known for throwing down at a moment's notice and always coming out on top. A hopeless bruiser, he's been rejected by 50 girls in a row! All that changes when he meets the girl of his dreams, Haruko, and she's actually not afraid of him! When she introduces him to the game of basketball, his life is changed forever…  \n  \nNote: Includes a one-shot called 10 Days After. \n\n[Official English](https://www.viz.com/slam-dunk) \n\n---\n  \n- **Won the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award for Shonen In 1995**\n- **One of top 10 highest selling Manga in history, with over 170 Million copies sold as of 2017**\n- **In 2010, Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association (JBA) for his contributions to the sport**",
   "pt-br": "Slam Dunk traz a história de Hanamichi Sakuragi, um estudante do colegial delinquente apaixonado pela delicada Haruko Akagi, que o introduz ao mundo do basquete. A partir daí, o desajeitado personagem começa a se envolver no esporte, em fazer parte de uma equipe e a se desenvolver como atleta e pessoa."
