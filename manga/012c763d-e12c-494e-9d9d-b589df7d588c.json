   "en": "Mitsuteru Yokoyama, who finished serializing \"Tetsujin 28'' which continued for 11 and a half years with \"Shonen'', a full-fledged racer story drawn after \"Tetsujin'', took on a new challenge in a new field with ``Shonen'' in January 1968. A full-fledged racer manga that started with the first issue. Shinichi Wakabayashi, a young man whose father was a genius racer who died in an accident, joins a racing team with the aim of becoming a racer like his father. He grows into a racer who competes around the world while competing with his rivals. This is an ambitious work that aims to create original entertainment while incorporating realistic expressions influenced by the graphic novels that were popular at the time. It was discontinued in the March 1969 issue due to suspension of publication of the magazine. The sequel, which was published in the \"Shonen Book,'' has been made into a book, but this is the first time that the \"Shonen'' version has been included. Most of the parts are reproduced from the manuscript, including 2 pages of color pages and 18 pages of color doors. The appendix includes the middle story \"Red Zone'' published in \"Bessatsu Shonen Magazine'' in 1969.\n\n[Recommended information from the editor]\nOn 2 pages of the color doors, characters of famous graphic novelists who were serialized in \"Shonen\" at the time appear in collaboration. This is a valuable record of manga history."
