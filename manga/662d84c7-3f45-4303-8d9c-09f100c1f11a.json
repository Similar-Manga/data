   "en": "The remaining content of The Domestic Yapoo, adapted by Ishinomori's assistant Sugar Sato with Ishinomori supervising. Note that there was a large gap between these and Ishinomori's.\n\n - **Vol 2:  The Nightmare History of Japan Arc**  (悪夢の日本史編, Akumu no Nihonshheni, January 1st, 1984) - (from ebookjapan): A Japanese man named Rin is brought to the space empire EHS, which rules the world 2000 years later. There, white women rule the world, and the Japanese are domesticated animals called yapoos. How were the Japanese, who had been modified into bodies specialized for their respective roles as human chairs, flesh toys, vehicles, etc., domesticated! The gods of Japanese mythology were white women from EHS! Volume 2 reveals the history of the primitive Yapoo tribe.\n - **Vol 3: The Pleasurable Super SM Culture Arc** (快楽の超ＳＭ文明編, Kairaku no Chou SM Bunmeihen, May 1st, 1993) - (from ebookjapan): In EHS, an empire dominated by white women, Rin, a Japanese from an earlier era, has been physically altered and castrated. He is reunited with Clara, but she has adapted to the aristocratic society of EHS and already has a new lover. Rin and Clara, lovers until yesterday, are no longer anything more than slave and mistress. As Rin is forced to listen to the humiliating history of his homeland, Japan, at Clara's side, not only his body but also his self-esteem is neutered.\n- **Vol 4: The Unconditional Surrender Arc** (無条件降伏編, Mujoukenkoufukuhen, March 25th, 1994) - (from ebookjapan): Two thousand years later, in the cosmic empire of EHS, the descendants of the Japanese, the yapoos, were nothing more than domestic animals, tools and consumables of the white man. They were not only toilet bowls (settsin), but also womb animals (yapum) that carried children, vaginal infants (tunnel boys) that served as contraceptives, and all sorts of other things. Determined to devote his life to being Clara's yapoo, Rin has let his natural canine nature blossom ....... The manga version of the outstanding masochistic literature is now complete!"

     "en": "石森章太郎\nIshinomori Shotaro\n==\nReal name Onodera Shotaro. He was known as Ishimori Shotaro before 1986 when he changed his name to Ishinomori Shotaro.\n\nWhile he was in high school, he made his debut with Nikyu Tenshi in Manga Shônen (1954). Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga. He was also one of the most productive creators, producing over 120,000 pages of artwork in thirty years. It's rumored that he drew over 500 pages in one month!"
