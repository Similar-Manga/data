Maestro Shotaro Ishinomori = original work, Akira Oze (Megumu Matsumoto) = super valuable work by golden members of drawing = \"Kamen Rider V3\" (1973-74), \"Kamen Rider X\" (1974) are the long-awaited first books!\nThere are many comicalizations of the \"Kamen Rider\" series, but this work with the pen of Akira Oze (under the name of \"Megumu Matsumoto\" at the time of serialization), who later drew masterpieces such as \"Natsuko's Sake\" Outstanding power. In particular, \"V3\" is a unique work that greatly features the solitary famous character \"Riderman / Joji Yuki\". A major feature of both \"V3\" and \"X\" is that in addition to action and coolness, we put a lot of effort into portraying people. This is a must-read book for fans!\n◆ Akira Oze's illustrations for color graphs at the time of serialization are reproduced as much as possible based on existing manuscripts!\n◆ New interview with Akira Oze = \"Making of\"・V3/X (provisional title)” is specially recorded!\nFrom a reprint request received from a user: “Even though I was a child, I felt a different atmosphere from other “Kamen Rider” manga. I definitely want to read it again!! \"It's a work that hasn't been published as a book, so it's natural that it hasn't been on the market.\" \"Kamen Rider is a cultural heritage that Japan should be proud of to the world. It must never be buried.\""
