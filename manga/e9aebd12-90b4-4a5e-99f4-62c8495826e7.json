   "en": "Two young men find their lives intersecting again and again. Franz Kreustein is the disgraced son of a duke, and has a deep-rooted hatred for the name Ludwig, and anyone who bears that name. The other being Ludwig van Beethoven, son of a low-ranking court player, is determined to become a great musician in his own right - and on his own terms.\n\nAn incident when they were younger leaves Ludwig with hearing problems, ultimately leading to him becoming deaf. How can a musician who cannot hear still succeed?\n\nTezuka's manga biography of Ludwig van Beethoven. Incomplete due to his death.\n\n[Official English](https://emanga.com/products/ludwig-b-vol-1?variant=32122478406)\n\n---\n**Volumes 337 and 338 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
