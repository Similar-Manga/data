   "en": "\"If you don't know your sexual orientation, why don't you try sleeping with me?\"\nYuzuru Nishina is a third-year university student who doesn't really know his own sexual orientation or what it feels like to \"like\" someone.\nWhile drunk at a pub he was forced to go to by a fellow seminar member, he reunites with Hase Ryosuke, a tea ceremony practitioner who was captivated by his beautiful manners at tea ceremonies when he was a child.\nWhen he gets drunk and asks for love advice, Hase presses him, saying, \"Well, why don't you try it with me?\"\nBehind his carefree facade, Ryosuke is tied to the traditional family business and his family, and Yuzuru faces him honestly despite being pushed around -- the path of first love that is forged by the tea ceremony."
