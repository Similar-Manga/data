   "en": "Masumi Takato was taught karate by his grandfather from an early age, and dreamed of becoming the best in Japan in karate. When he entered high school, he washed away from the masculine world of karate and led a popular and refreshing high school life. I was about to. Masumi falls in love with Matsuri Himuro at first sight when he meets her on the day of her entrance ceremony , and joins the same mountain climbing club as her. Masumi works with the unique members of the mountain climbing club and engages in activities that are not typical of a mountain climbing club, and while facing many obstacles, he deepens his relationship with his girlfriend Matsuri."
