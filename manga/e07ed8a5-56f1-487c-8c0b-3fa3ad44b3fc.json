   "en": "For the entirety of his life, Yokoda Takashi has been drawing erotic drawings and it has been his way of expressing his sexuality. And now, he has managed to become a successful erotic comedy manga author for a monthly magazine. His series stars a character named Aimi who is actually based loosely on his niece with the same name. He keeps his job a secret, especially from his family from the fear that using Aimi's name in such a perverted way would cause hatred from everyone. But his manga's popularity rises and gets moved to a weekly magazine where there are vastly more readers and it seems like only a matter of time until the truth comes out. Takashi has to struggle between protecting his secret while keeping up with the production and erotic creativeness that comes with a weekly magazine series."
