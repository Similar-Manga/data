   "en": "Watch the masked detective hero Condor King!!\nA huge action story drawn by Tsunayoshi Takeuchi of \"Akadou Suzunosuke''\nand \"Shonen Jet''!\n[Synopsis]\nWorld-renowned biologist Dr. Batter has been kidnapped! The elusive ally of justice, Condor King, investigates the incident with young reporter Hiro and silly cameraman Ishi-san. They chase, but are thwarted by the monster Groo... (Monster Glo Volume)\n\n[Explanation]\n\"Condor King'', which began serialization in Kodansha's \"Bokura'' in 1961, is a detective adventure work by Tsunayoshi Takeuchi.\n\nAt that time, Tsunayoshi Takeuchi had written \"Akadou Suzunosuke'' after Eiichi Fukui's death, and had also serialized ``Shonen Jet,'' which was made into a drama, and had become a popular manga artist. This work attracted attention for its design of the Condor King, who fights with cards as a weapon in a black hat, yellow mask, and stylish suit, as well as for its classic detective action story. This time, we will record all episodes and short stories published in \"Bokura\".\n\nI want you to think about the success of a \"hero in disguise'' on a par with ``Moonlight Mask'' or \"Phantom Detective.''"
