   "en": "Zhi Zi is a very intelligent girl with a strong personality who is studying at a boarding school. One day, her uncle suddenly steals all of the money that her parents left her and runs away. Zhi Zi has no other choice but to withdraw from school. Just before she leaves, she confesses to Gui, a very gentle guy from her school, but he says to Zhi Zi that he cannot accept her feelings because he can’t have a normal relationship, due to some personal issues.\nWhile Zhi Zi is wandering around the streets, she meets a business man called Ging. Zhi Zi tells him about her situation, and he offers to help her out financially with the condition that she work for his company after she graduates from university. A few days later, Zhi Zi goes to Ging’s house to help him clean. There, she finds out that Ging is actually the older brother of Gui and Gui's biggest secret…!?"
