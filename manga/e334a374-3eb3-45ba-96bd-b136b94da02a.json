   "en": "The year is 2XXX AD, and basketball has become the most popular sport in the universe. However, the Intergalactic Leagueâ€“-the pinnacle of professional basketballâ€“- is completely dominated by extraterrestrials. Widely renowned as the best of basketball is an extraterrestrial named Gyuma, despite the fact that he is merely 19-years-old.   \n  \nInto this arena steps Yoshimune, an old man who believes that it`s humans who should be number one in basketball. His plan is to collect the best team of pure humans there is, and attempt to win the Intergalactic League.   \n  \nYoshimune puts out a call for the best human players, and a 14-year-old named Hideyoshi answers the call."
