   "en": "Keitaro has had great difficulty getting into the university of his choice and no luck in meeting women. In a desperate effort to go into seclusion and study for his entrance exams, he volunteers to take over running his grandmother's hotel. His plans are ruined when he discovers that the \"hotel\" is actually an all-girls dormitory… and some serious distractions ensue.  \n  \nWon the 25nd Kodansha Manga Award for Best Shounen Manga.",
   "pt-br": "Love Hina conta a história de Keitarô Urashima, um rapaz de 20 anos de idade que já foi reprovado 3 vezes na Universidade de Tóquio, mas continua tentando por ter feito uma promessa a uma menina há 15 anos atrás. Ele se torna gerente de um alojamento feminino e acaba rodeado de garotas: Na maior parte do tempo Keitarô surpreende-as nuas sem querer (quase sempre em uma onsen, ou terma japonesa) e recebe golpes fenomenais de artes marciais. Os personagens de Love Hina são quase todos mulheres, porém um dos dois personagens principais é homem: isso mostra a inspiração da série em jogos simulador"

Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina.
