   "en": "Emi, a dumpling-headed elementary school student, withdrew her thoughts. She was able to be in the same class as Kokubunji-kun, who she admires, but confessing is outrageous. I can't even show my affection honestly. At the very least, I write down the story of a cool character named Amy, a female warrior, in my notebook. Ah, I wish I could say what I want to say... Then she finds an old-fashioned headband in her mother's jewelry box. It's amazing when you put it on her hair! My reflection in her mirror looks exactly like the image I had in mind of Amy. Somehow, I had a strange courage. In this way, Emi meets Kokubunji-kun with Katyusha's help from time to time, and little by little they become friends. The fireworks just for the two of us and the wonderful costume parade, the memories are increasing, but in reality, Katyusha has a big secret! The long-awaited sequel to \"Miracle Mimi Kun\" (5 volumes in total) has been released as a book for the first time! It is the emergence of a spirited love"
