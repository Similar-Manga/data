   "en": "A collection of short stories.  \n  \nNinjin Daisuki (Tody):\nA little boy named Takashi-chan hates eating carrots, so one night, he prays that somehow, he will be able to like eating them. Little does he know how dangerous this wish turns out to be...\n\nSaishuu Bus (The Last Bus):\nSachiko visits Hitomi in her new rural home on the pretext of visiting an old friend. She gets on the last bus back to avoid having to stay at Hitomi's creepy new house, but...\n\nFamily:\nYuka lives with her gentle father and mother and mischievous, but cute, younger sister Eri. Things seem like they should be so happy, but why is it that sometimes Yuka feels so uneasy? What important memory is she forgetting?\n\nNoriawaseta Shinigami (Evil Spirit):\nMiya was supposed to just take her father his lunch, but an earthquake stops the elevator she is on. Before the lights go off, a woman calls out that there is a shinigami (a grim reaper) among them, but suddenly dies before everyone is able to see where she pointed. Was the woman just crazy or is everyone's life now in grave danger?\n\nSoshite Yami wa Yomigaeru (Inviting Darkness):\nMinori is on a trip to a small lodge in the mountains with her school club. They are specifically going because the site is rumored to be frequented by UFOs, and they want to investigate. They are meeting Minori's cousin, Naoki, there, but why is it that Minori keeps experiencing deja vu?"
