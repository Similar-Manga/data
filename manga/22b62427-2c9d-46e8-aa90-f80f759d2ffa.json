   "en": "Yoshihiro Morifuji of \"Microman\" draws \"Transformers\", a dream collaboration work miraculously revived! It is a completely original story in which Superion and Menazor of \"Transformers Unite Warriors\", which has been developing toys since 2015, demonstrates the main feature of \"scramble combination\" that replaces limbs and makes a big success. Anomalous phenomena caused by sunspots were occurring all over the world. The cause was Destron's new weapon, the Omega Wave Cannon. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Destrons were looting energy from all over the Earth. On the other hand, Cybertron was in a rescue operation and was unable to fight back against the Decepticons. Convoy Boy Corps captain Toru, physicist Jenny, and scout Hound, who were conducting their own investigations, were also captured by the Destrons. Finally, the strongest Destron Stantron unit attacks the nuclear power plant, and commander Convoy has no choice but to dispatch a new airbot unit with no actual combat experience. Will Convoy, who takes command of the new battle base, Scramble City, have a plan to reverse Megatron's ambitions? First appearance: \"Comic Bonbon\" (Kodansha) 1986 Spring Break Special Edition Family Computer Special Special Issue"
