   "en": "Emily Addisio, with her acceptance letter in hand, enters the academe, featuring of a happy academy life, but she suddenly gets into an accident. Ethan Valenti, who accidentally helped her, gradationally becomes attracted to Emily, and Emily also feels shocked by his aggressive style. Before Emily could feel a strange sense of relief, he seized the window hedge with his right hand, which reached up to his midriff, and fluently jumped inside the structure. ” What?” In a moment, a dark shadow fell on Emily, who was amazed by the unforeseen narrow distance. That was because Lord Valenti, who is higher than her, was looking at her with his reverse leaning against the window. And as the shadow girdled her, Emily artificially tried to step back. But before she could move, Valenti reached out to snare the handkerchief she was holding.” Thank you, Emily. That was kind of you, but you did not have to return it.” The beautiful romantic story of Emily, which is ordinary but always girdled by extraordinary situations, and Ethan, who gave her his first and last love."
