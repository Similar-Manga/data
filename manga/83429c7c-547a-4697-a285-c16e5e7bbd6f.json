   "en": "That fateful year that decided the path to becoming a manga artist. Fujihiko Hosono, creator of \"Gu-Gu Gunmo\", \"As expected of Sarutobi\" and \"Gallery Fake\", drew for the first time his best friend, family, benefactor, and himself when he was young. In 1978, a young Saino and his friends attend a famous private university in Tokyo. They were talented people who would later go on to become manga artists and animators, but at that time they were just young people enjoying their maniac student life. The era is the late 70's when Japanese subculture is rising. With an alcoholic father, a handicapped younger brother, and a complicated family environment, young Hosono begins to walk the path of a manga artist himself, even though he is troubled and lost. Recommended by Haruka Takachiho (Studio Nue)!! “By skillfully mixing fact and fiction, we spin the story of life."
