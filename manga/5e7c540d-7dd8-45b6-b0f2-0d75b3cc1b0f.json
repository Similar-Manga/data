   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nAkane is the third daughter of a prestigious family, the Kamijo family. Because of her weak health, she was sent to live with her uncle Sosuke in the countryside for a while to recuperate.... Six years later, Akane, now a free-spirited tomboy, returns to the Kamijo family! Akane causes a great commotion wherever she goes, but her heart is kinder and more compassionate than anyone else's. She lives a bright and strong life and has a lot of courage from Akane. This is a story that will give you a lot of courage from Akane, who lives a bright and strong life.\n\n*Was also adapted into an anime that aired from April 6, 1968 to September 29, 1968 on Fuji TV under the name \"Akane-chan\". The manga's title was altered to Akane-chan when the anime adaption aired. Some releases after revert the title back to Misokkasu, while others retain '\"Akane-chan.\" An animanga was done for Misokkasu titled \"Akane-chan and Sakura-chan\" by the younger Chiba brother Akio.*"
