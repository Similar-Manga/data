   "en": "\"Who are you!?''\n\"Hello, Yusei Kamen!''\nThe classic lines that took the world by storm once again!\nThe comic adaptation of the blockbuster anime has been made into a complete book for the first time!\n\nSpecial interview with Takaharu Kusunoki, the author of\nthe anime setting material collection with the cooperation of Aiken.\n\nSynopsis:\nIn the year 2001, the planet Pinelon, which has the same orbit as Earth, was discovered.\nThe people of the beautiful, highly civilized Planet Pineron welcomed the exploration rocket that came from Earth, and since then, a friendly relationship has been established between Earth and the Planet Pineron.\nHowever, there is one person who is not happy about the relationship between the two planets... Huygens, Director of the Pineron Space Bureau, and his subordinate Dr. Imoshi.\n15 years later, a rocket from Earth causes an unknown nuclear explosion in the Pineron city of Toronto, and this accident sparks a fierce space war between the two peaceful planets! An all-out attack by the Pineron side, which boasts overwhelming scientific power. Just as Earth was about to be attacked, a mysterious boy wearing a mask and cloak appeared on a small space rocket rider...\n\nCommentary\n\"Yusei Kamen'' is the third installment of Glico Theater (Fuji Television) following \"Gigantor'' and \"Yusei Shonen Pappy'', and was produced by TCJ (now Aiken) and aired for a total of 39 episodes from June 1966. It is a TV anime.\nHe appeared with one of the most famous lines in anime history, \"Hold on, come on, Yusei Kamen!'' and the heroic figure of Yusei Kamen, who fights against evil with his deadly weapons Ultra Shooter and Small Space Rocket Rider, captivated many children.\nIn addition, sponsor Ezaki Glico released \"Yusei Kamen Glico,'' which came with a bonus toy, and its popularity remained unwavering.\nBy the way, if you collected and sent in the points for \"Yusei Kamen Glico,'' you could win a \"Yusei Kamen Dress-up Set'' in a lottery, but it was a phantom prize that was difficult for even those involved to obtain.\n\nWith a favorable wind, the manga version of \"Yusei Kamen'', which follows the setting of the anime version, has started simultaneously in Shueisha's monthly boys' magazine \"Shonen Book'', Shogakukan's school year magazine \"Shogakukan Book'', and \"Elementary School 3rd Grade''\n! While the Shogakukan Book version and the \"Third Grade Elementary School'' version focused on the storyline, the Shogakukan Book version and the \"Third Grade Elementary School'' version were developed in the form of short stories, each consisting of a single episode. The illustrations are by Takaharu Kusunoki, who is also responsible for the character designs for the anime version.\nWith the sharp pen touch of his master, Jiro Kuwata, he beautifully depicts a futuristic world that highlights his unique science fiction perspective."
