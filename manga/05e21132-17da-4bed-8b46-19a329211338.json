   "en": "Many years ago, an evil witch ruled the continent, and she had many magical treasures. Now the land is ruled by a king, but the witch's treasures remain. A young amateur thief named Sue is determined to sneak into the nearby ruins and steal treasure to help her poor village. On her way, she runs into one of the 3 legendary thieves, Marshmellow, who is obsessed with beauty. He isn't quite as suave as she'd expected, but he seems to have the same eyes as the ancient witch. After their first adventure together, Sue joins him on his journey to collect all the witch's treasures. He claims he is only interested in their beauty, but what will happen if he actually recovers them all?  \n  \n**Included one-shots:**  \n- Volume 1: Ymir no Majin *(ユミルの魔人)*  \nAfter a ten year long war broke out, there were displaced soldiers called Rabi who can manipulate and create golems for the sake of battle. Many turned to becoming bandits, but there was one man among them who chose to fight against fellow Rabi. His name is Humpty, and this is his story.  \n- Volume 2: Parasite B *(パラサイトB)*  \nThis is a story of an organization called B-Kikan made up of Jittoku, Nemu, and their boss. They help fight against Insects, parasitic organisms made by the government that feed on human bodies for nutrients.  \n- Volume 3: Mitsukubi Condor *(pilot)*\n"
