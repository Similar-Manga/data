   "en": "He has a gigantic figure, a face like an oni tile, and his fighting arms are of course top-notch. He has 17 previous assault convictions. When Matsugoro Hojo was standing there drunk, was he from the future? A baby is sent. I can't leave it alone while it's snowing. And above all, the baby is only attached to Matsugoro. So Matsugoro decided to raise him. It was a boy, and he named it Ai. In addition to Matsugoro, Ai becomes unusually attached to a cute female police officer named Ryo Akimoto. Ryo's family has a father who doesn't seem to be a strong man, but he is also devoted to Ai and Matsugoro. If you go to the zoo, even the ferocious animals will fall in love with you!?"
