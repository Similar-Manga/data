   "en": "Promotion? oppose?\n――Before that, everything about nuclear power plants that you want to know properly!\nSince 3.11, people have been making a fuss about \"nuclear power plants,\" but I'm sure there are many people who don't know how this accident happened or what nuclear power is in the first place. Even if you want to know, it's really difficult to understand how it works and technical terms!\nYou don't have to know now! It's not a problem, but I don't understand even if it's explained in technical books and characters! For all of you, manga artist Kengo Kawaguchi will use his body to draw \"Chernobyl\", \"Fukushima nuclear power plant\", \"Plutonium\", \"Monju\", \"Uranium and nuclear fission\", and \"Atomic bomb\".\nAnd to make it easier to understand, I've thoroughly compared it!\nIs a nuclear power plant a beast? Is plutonium a night butterfly? Monju is an ace pitcher! ?\nHave fun reading, understanding, growling, and thinking!"
