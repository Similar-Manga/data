   "en": "The time is 4th century , further down from \"Jinmu\" , during the era of Emperor Suinin . In Yamato, there is a social structure consisting of the Hyuga imperial family, whose founder was Iwarehiko (= Emperor Jinmu ), and the Izumo tribe, whose founder was Tsunomi , who served the imperial family.\n\nNomi no Sukune and Tagima no Kehaya of the Izumo tribe compete in an imperial sumo match by order of the Emperor, but this was a ploy to seize the land of Touma, which was ruled by Kehaya. Keisara was defeated and died, and the Emperor, in order to hide his plan, gave the land of Toma to the Sukune clan and plotted to take indirect control. Isachi, Isachi's son, makes Sukune his father's enemy and secludes himself in the mountains to train.\n\nThe people of Toma, who were driven from their ancestral land, suffer from poverty. However, even though the Izumo tribe was supposed to have won, they were forced to pay heavy taxes, making their lives even more difficult. And the Emperor, who was supposed to be the true victor, was suffering as though his beloved son was unable to speak or stand up, perhaps due to some kind of curse.\n\nOne day, Sukune suddenly becomes paralyzed in the mountains and collapses. The technique ``Three-Year Kill'' that was once applied to him has started to work like a curse or divine punishment. When Sukune, his father's enemy, fell alone, it was Shidori, Shidori's orphaned son..."
