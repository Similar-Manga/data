   "en": "Kosuke Miyamoto, a first-year student in the Kendo Club of Metropolitan Eichi High School. He was suspected of stealing a girl's pants during a training camp, so he decided to fight Minami, a powerful 3-dan in three years. Miyamoto lost, but will be added to the next team competition. However, he was seriously injured when he caught Madonna Momoko from the school who attempted suicide by jumping off the roof. Even so, Miyamoto, who forced himself to participate, became a general. In the tactics of the team match, it is a plan to win three wins before the general match and decide the victory. However, the result was 2 to 2, and the victory or defeat was decided by the general match. Miyamoto wins against the enemy's general, Tsuruta, and Eichi advances to the second round."
