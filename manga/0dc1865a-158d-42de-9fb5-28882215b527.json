   "en": "Ayame is back as a college girl! Ayame Nishibojo is a winsome and vain girl. She attends a women's college in Tokyo and lives freely. She is invited on a ski trip by her boyfriend, Ozome-kun, who is not her boyfriend, and she believes that her daily life goes by happily and peacefully. Then one day, due to her parents' circumstances, the whole family suddenly decides to move to Sendai. Ayame, who still has some university life left, has no choice but to live alone. However, the gap between her ideal and reality is huge, and Ayame struggles to make ends meet. The rent is expensive, she oversleeps, the garbage cannot be taken out, and her room is a mess. She wonders if she will be able to survive in the jungle that is the big city! This is a college student romantic comedy with a powerful heroine who falls seven times in love and life.\n\n(google translated)"
