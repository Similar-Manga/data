   "en": "Black Jack is an \"unregistered\" doctor with a clouded, mysterious past. He works with his little assistant Pinoko (who has a massive crush on the doctor), dealing with medical cases not very well known, which can be strange, dangerous, or not known at all. But he is a genius, and can save almost any of his patients' lives (as long as they have the money for it), and is known to many around the world, especially to those of medicine and science. He's a man of science himself, and does not believe much until he has seen it, yet it is many times he is surprised by love and nature often overpowering the science he bases his life in.  \n\nOut of total 243 chapters chapter 113.5: 'U-18 Knew' was released in weakly shonen champin special issue and those it's unnumbered. Also 11 chapters were not included in the Vertical English release, out of those 11 chapters: 3 were exclusively Included in the hardcover editions of volumes 1-3, and also 5 of them are labeled as [Sealed](http://tezukainenglish.com/wp/?page_id=573) meaning they have been excluded from almost every collected release because they were controversial or Osamu wasn't happy with them.\n\n[Official English](https://kodansha.us/series/black-jack/)\n  \n---\n- **Won the 1st Kodansha Manga Award for Shonen in 1977, which it shared with Tezuka's other serial, Three-Eyed One**\n- **Won the 4th Japan Cartoonists Association Special Excellence Award in 1975**\n---\nThe following link takes you to AnimeNewsNetwork for the anime adaptation, OVAs, movies, etc.:  \n[ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1341)\n\n---\n**Volumes 151-168, 366 and 367, 370 and 371 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
