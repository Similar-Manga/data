   "en": "Once upon a time in Evergreen, two humanoid races, said to be the descendants of gods, fought for the authority to rule the world. One is the shamans who are highly intelligent, use magic a lot, and fly with wings on their backs . The other was the Go- Majin tribe with horns on their heads, with a strong body and strong power, who took nature as an ally . The conflict between the two races threatened even the powerless other races and became extremely fierce. However, a legendary warrior who is said to wake up when evergreen is in danger is born into the shaman tribe, and the conflict ends with its power. The shaman tribe that won the battle ruled the world, and the defeated Gouma deity tribe was driven to the end of the world, ``Mt. In human terms, it was a long time ago.\n\nNow that time has passed since the battle between the two races. Shakuma , the most violent boy in Goumajin's village, wanted to \"go meet someone stronger than me\", and at the end of his desire to fight against the legendary shaman warriors, broke the village's rules and jumped out of the barrier. , I was sending days to be suppressed by the elders. However, the power of the growing Shakma has reached a critical level, whether it can be suppressed by the villagers anymore. Today as well, Shakma was locked up in a prison by the elders, but with his growing power, he broke out of the prison and escaped. Shakma was thinking of leaving the village and going to the shaman king to challenge him to a match, ignoring the troubles of the villagers . Light flew and charged towards Shakma. The true identity of the light is the beast demon girl Anes , who was magically sent to Shakuma for some reason . She was in a state of amnesia , unable to remember why she was sent away or why she was with Shakma.\n\nUnable to leave Anes crying in despair, Shakuma reluctantly took her back to the village . He sent the beast (monster) Hydra to attack Goumajin's village. Hydra was repelled by Shakuma's courage and Lovelace retreated to prepare the system, but the villagers were turned into stone by Hydra's ability, and the village was destroyed. Only the special magic of King Shaman can remove the petrification of Hydra. The elder allowed Shakma to become a messenger for the king, and Anes also accompanied Shakma on his journey to solve the \"mystery of memory\" that was hidden in himself."
