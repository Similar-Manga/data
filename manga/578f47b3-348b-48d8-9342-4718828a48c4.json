   "en": "Probably one of the most difficult feats in manga is to tell a compelling short story, and Mitsuru Adachi is a master of the medium. This selection of some of his best short works include two tales in the dangerous life of a pretty private-eye-to-be; a boy's stop-off on the way changes his life's destination; five short-shorts in a quirky cafe; Japan's future ace pitcher can't even throw a ball; when a school play goes bad, the world is a stage for love and karate; a drama of rugby and past lives; two off-beat time-travel tales; and more! Mitsuru Adachi's low-key but high-impact stories are a must read for any manga aficionado.  \n  \nThis collection, titled simply Short Program, collected stories by Adachi published between 1985 and now.  \n  \n||Volume 1: (from Viz)  \nStory 1 - Change  \nStory 2 - Take Off  \nStory 3 - Short Program  \nStory 4 - What's Going On!?

After graduating from Gunma Prefectural Maebashi Commercial High School in 1969, Adachi worked as an assistant for Isami Ishii. He made his manga debut in 1970 with Kieta Bakuon, based on a manga originally created by Satoru Ozawa. Kieta was published in Deluxe Shōnen Sunday (a manga magazine published by Shogakukan) .\n\nMitsuru Adachi is well known for romantic comedy and sports manga (especially baseball) such as Touch, H2, Slow Step, Miyuki and Cross Game. He has been described as a writer of \"delightful dialogue\", a genius at portraying everyday life, \"the greatest pure storyteller\", and \"a master manga artist\". He is one of the few manga artists to write for shōnen, shōjo and seinen manga magazines, and be popular in all three.\n\nMitsuru is the youngest in the family, with two older brothers and one older sister. The second brother, [Adachi Tsutomu](https://mangadex.org/author/23fc6623-0e50-411a-a80b-5a8c01b3340a/adachi-tsutomu), was once the assistant of [Akatsuka Fujio](https://mangadex.org/author/609ce7f0-4f06-4074-90c3-5bd714f09e57/fujio-akatsuka), and Mitsuru was also affected in manga because of this, and his first work was also found with the help of his brother. However, after Mitsuru became famous, his brother's work still did not improve, and finally died of illness. Therefore, Mitsuru respected his second brother Tsutomu very much, and often depicted the image of friendly brothers in his manga.\n"
