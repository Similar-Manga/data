     "en": "Mitsuru Adachi (Japanese: あだち 充 or 安達 充, Hepburn: Adachi Mitsuru, born February 9, 1951) is a Japanese manga artist. After graduating from Gunma Prefectural Maebashi Commercial High School in 1969, Adachi worked as an assistant for Isami Ishii. He made his manga debut in 1970 with Kieta Bakuon, based on a manga originally created by Satoru Ozawa. Kieta was published in Deluxe Shōnen Sunday (a manga magazine published by Shogakukan) .\n\nMitsuru Adachi is well known for romantic comedy and sports manga (especially baseball) such as Touch, H2, Slow Step, Miyuki and Cross Game. He has been described as a writer of \"delightful dialogue\", a genius at portraying everyday life, \"the greatest pure storyteller\", and \"a master manga artist\". He is one of the few manga artists to write for shōnen, shōjo and seinen manga magazines, and be popular in all three.\n\nMitsuru is the youngest in the family, with two older brothers and one older sister. The second brother, [Adachi Tsutomu](https://mangadex.org/author/23fc6623-0e50-411a-a80b-5a8c01b3340a/adachi-tsutomu), was once the assistant of [Akatsuka Fujio](https://mangadex.org/author/609ce7f0-4f06-4074-90c3-5bd714f09e57/fujio-akatsuka), and Mitsuru was also affected in manga because of this, and his first work was also found with the help of his brother. However, after Mitsuru became famous, his brother's work still did not improve, and finally died of illness. Therefore, Mitsuru respected his second brother Tsutomu very much, and often depicted the image of friendly brothers in his manga.\n"
