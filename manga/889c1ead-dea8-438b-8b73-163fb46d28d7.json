   "en": "The main character , Tsuyoshi Dojima , was originally a top-notch baseball player who won Koshien, but just before he turned professional, he rebelled against falling prey to his father's money-based worship, and thrust a broken beer bottle into his left hand in front of his father. He stood up and his body was unable to hold the ball again. Dojima ended his career as a player and, at the recommendation of his mentor Negi, took a job as a baseball coach in Inosaru Village, a depopulated village on the outskirts of Matsuyama\nin Ehime Prefecture , Shikoku . I will take over.\n\nHowever, Inosaru Village is not just a \"countryside'' but a \"lawless zone'' where primitive people lived before civilization under the law of the fittest, and the nearby residents called it ``Apache Village'' and feared it. It was getting worse. At first, the people of Apache Village do not accept outsiders, but they gradually come to accept Dojima and together they strive to reach Koshien."
