   "en": "More horror stories from master Junji Ito.\n\n**The Soichi Front:**\nFor 10 years, a woman named Michina Hirose has been looking for any shred of evidence that could lead her to the missing Tsujii family. While in a certain town, she sees children acting strangely, spitting nails at others, and trying to curse people, just like the youngest Tsujii son—Souichi—used to do. Learning that the children only started behaving that way after visiting a local haunted house, she decides to investigate further, but ends up with far more than she bargained for.\n\n**Soichi's Beloved Pet:**\nA stray cat decides to follow Sayuri Tsujii home one day, and everyone in the house gets attached to her, deciding to name her Collon. But after Collon has a run-in with Sayuri's youngest brother—the gloomy, curse-happy Souichi—she begins to act strangely. Is this the result of a curse, or something else?\n\n**In The Valley of Mirrors:**\nThere is bitter enmity between two villages, facing each other across a river. But instead of erecting walls and battlements, they both decided to put up mirrors. What could this mean? And where did all the people disappear to, all those years ago?\n\n**Anything but a Ghost:**\nWhile driving on a mountain road one night, Shigeru finds a girl covered in blood.\n\n**Library of Illusions:**\nKoko lives with her husband Goro in a giant mansion full of books. The books are a family heirloom, and heâ??s fiercely protective of them, so it would really suck if something were to happen to them...\n\n**Songs in the Dark:**\nThere are songs that stick with us long after we've heard them; the song Tamayo hears while passing a street musician is one of those. However, even with a doctor's visit and medication, the song won't leave her. Seeking resolution, she tracks down the musician, Yu Kanade, and discovers that this \"brain noise\" is contagious, with Yu's entire audience falling prey to it. But why is Yu's song stuck in everyone's head?\n\n**Splatter Film:**\nOgi got lost while traveling in South America, but was saved by a kind tribe of people who sent him home with a pot of delicious nectar from a plant their religion is focused around. At home, he offers some to his friend Sugio, but warns him that he must not be noticed while eating it. Sugio loves the nectar, and finds that regular food just can't compare, so he and some of Ogi's other friends sneak in to eat it. However, they are met with a grisly sight, which is only just the beginning of the strange events that will befall them."
