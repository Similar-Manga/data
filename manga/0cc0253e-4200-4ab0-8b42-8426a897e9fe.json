   "en": "\"I want to see him cumming with pleasure...more.\" Igarashi Kakeru, an ordinary high school student, has a grudge against Otori Keigo, the student council president. Keigo is a self-proclaimed super elite with good looks and is popular with girls, but he is arrogant. One day, Kakeru and his friends go on a bad spree and decide to go and mess with Keigo by themselves. He had only interacted with Keigo once in middle school, and was overconfident that Keigo wouldn't remember him, an ordinary commoner. However, Keigo remembered Kakeru very well. Surprisingly, they were having fun talking about silly things, when Keigo asked Kakeru to \"teach him some entertainment for the common people.\" Kakeru's mischievous side comes from the fact that Keigo is handsome but not popular with women, and he boasts that he will teach him how to love... but Keigo takes it seriously and even asks him to \"practice\" it!?"
