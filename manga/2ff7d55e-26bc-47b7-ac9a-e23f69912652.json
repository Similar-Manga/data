   "en": "The Ebiru family of demons suddenly appeared in a peaceful town! They were exiled from the demon world to \"do bad things in the human world\", but when they met Shotaro, an energetic elementary school student, there was a big commotion! A devilish comedy with a bit of H.\n\nThe Ebiru family came to the human world because Papa Ebiru, who was in charge in the 1900s, could not destroy humanity even in 1999. The Ebiru family has been banished to the human world as punishment for the wrath of the devil king, Satan. And if you collect 1000 \"Evil Coins\" that you can get by doing bad things, you can return to the demon world. As a result, Ebiru and the others plan various evil deeds using the beasts that come out of Gachademon machines, but... The first collection comically depicts the turmoil caused by Shotaro, who has become close to the human world, and Ebiru and others.\n\nOne day, the Ebiru-kun family moves in next door to Shotaro, an elementary school student who is always energetic. Papa Ebiru, who was the devil in charge in 1999, was sent to the human world because he could not destroy the human race. Ebiru-kun and his friends do a lot of bad things and can't go back to hell unless they accumulate 1000 Evil Coins. ? A cute baby devil, a strange demon beast, and even a sexy girl! ! A devilish comedy that is a little erotic, unleashed by Kia Asamiya!!"
