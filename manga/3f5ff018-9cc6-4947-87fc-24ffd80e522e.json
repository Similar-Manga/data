     "en": "Rumiko Takahashi (高橋 留美子, Takahashi Rumiko, born October 10, 1957) is a Japanese manga artist. With a career of several commercially successful works, beginning with Urusei Yatsura in 1978, Takahashi is one of Japan's best-known and wealthiest manga artists. Her works are popular worldwide, where they have been translated into a variety of languages, with over 200 million copies in circulation. She has won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice, once in 1980 for Urusei Yatsura and again in 2001 for Inuyasha, and the Seiun Award twice, once in 1987 for Urusei Yatsura and again in 1989 for Mermaid Saga. She also received the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême in 2019, becoming the second woman and second Japanese to win the prize. In 2020, the Japanese government awarded Takahashi the Medal with Purple Ribbon for her contributions to the arts.\n\nShe enrolled in Koike Kazuo’s Gekiga Sonjuku as one of inaugural students along with Yamamoto Atsuji, Akane Koka, Caribu Marley, Sakuma Akira, Kikuchi Hideyuki, Kudo Kazuya, Kataoka Tetsuji, Shiki Takashi, Tanaka Akio, Saotome Masayuki, Miyaoka Hiroshi and Takeda Masatoshi.\n\nKamiyo Akimine, Shimizu Aya, Chiba Konami, Fujisawa Moyashi and Saito Kuniko were once her assistants.\n\nTakahashi once had a meeting with Sakuma and Toriyama Akira about a collaboration work, but it seems it ended up with only Sakuma and Toriyama participating in the joint project."
