   "en": "Misora has lost her place to live after her company went bankrupt. She is alone in the world and has no one to rely on, and when she runs out of savings, she collapses in a park. She wonders if she is going to die..... \nBut the next time she wakes up, she finds that she has been put to sleep in a magnificent mansion! Living in the house was a young man, Rasen, and his four children, who seemed to be somewhat out of touch with the world. When Rasen heard that she had fallen ill, he said to her, “That's just what I was looking for. Then you can take care of the children.” Misora was offered to work as a housekeeper. She accepts the offer with unbeatable conditions, but it seems that there is a reason for this family...."
