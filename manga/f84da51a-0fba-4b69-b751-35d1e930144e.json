   "en": "Taihei Misaki, who works for a major general contractor, is depressed. Due to his boss's mistake, he was forced to work overtime until the morning, and he had to cancel his date with his girlfriend. Moreover, such things have been going on many times, and the relationship between the two has become estranged. However, Taihei is unable to cut corners on his work and manages to complete the task until morning. When Taihei goes to her house, he sees her getting out of the car driven by her manager. As he grows tired of everything, he sees a notice in his eyes that says \"Recruiting crew members for deep-sea tuna fishing boats.\""
