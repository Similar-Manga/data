   "en": "New York.\nFew people know that such an office exists inside this building, which symbolizes world peace . Its name is TULIP, or The Undercover Line of International Police. This organization is spread all over the world, and the people who work there are colloquially known as spy catchers. This is the year 1965 , when a huge spy boom occurred with the arrival of\n\"007'' and \"0011 Napoleon Solo'' in Japan. \"Spy Catcher J3'', which can be called a Japanese-made 007, has appeared on the TV in the living room. The original screenplay was written by mystery writer Michio Tsuzuki, and the cast included Tetsuro Tamba, who was known for his presence in gangster movies at the time. The film attracted a lot of attention for its smart sense that was suitable for adult viewing. It became the origin of Toei action dramas that continued with \"G-Men ''75''. This book is the first book to compile all the stories of the manga version, which was serialized in Kodansha's monthly magazine for boys, \"Bokura'', in parallel with the TV drama airing . The artist is Takashi Horie, who has worked on many period dramas and western dramas. He specializes in flashy action scenes, and has brilliantly adapted into a comic the famous scene in which the main character's modified Corvette Stingray flies through the sky and rides on water."
