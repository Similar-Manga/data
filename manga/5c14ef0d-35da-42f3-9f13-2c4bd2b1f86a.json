   "en": "How do you distinguish between the love from a cute neighborhood girl (who’s like a little sister to you), and the love from the hottest, yet quirky, girl in school? This is exactly the question Myung-Ho has to ponder when both his neighbor’s cute little daughter, Ji-Hae, and his school’s most popular diva, Yu-Ri, make him their valentines. Of course he cares for Ji-Hae, because the poor girl’s already been through so much for someone her age, but still, she’s only just a kid. Then there’s Yu-Ri, the girl of his dreams…or rather, she would be if she wasn’t a fortune-telling voodoo witch doctor. Oh and yes, it would also help if her father, the local gangster boss, wasn’t out to kill him.  \n  \nWhen you’re as lucky as Myung-Ho is(?) choices are very hard to make. On one hand, he could go out with Yu-Ri by turning down Ji-Hae, breaking the heart of a child who’s been depending on him ever since she moved in next door. Or, he could choose Ji-Hae by turning down the only chance at romance with a beautiful girl dead set on making him her destined love. Choices, choices…"
