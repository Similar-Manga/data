   "en": "\"Sportsman Kintaro'' is a monumental baseball manga that was serialized in \"Weekly Shonen Sunday'' for five years starting with its first issue in 1959. Kintaro and Momotaro, celebrities from fairy tales, each join the Giants, Nishitetsu, and have a dream showdown with real-life players such as Oh, Nagashima, and Kaneda. The manga's healthy touch, which is a little different from the usual sports genre, was praised and won the first Kodansha Children's Manga Award. (The complete 9-volume version of Shonen Sunday is now on sale from Shosha.) This book will be published in the school year magazine \"Elementary School First (Second Grade)\" about six years after the series ended in Shonen Sunday. This is the first book that compiles the original works of the same title that were serialized. The story carefully depicts how Kintaro and his friend Kuro-chan, who join the Tokyo Gold, which belongs to a fictional professional baseball league, compete against rival players and American teams. Above all, you can get a glimpse of the author's ideal view of manga through the panel layout and dialogue arranged for school year magazines. Before this work, the same title was serialized for a total of 36 times in the April 1965 issue of \"Elementary School Fourth Grader\" to \"Elementary School Sixth Grader\" March 1968 issue, but this is a digest of the works published in Shonen Sunday.\n\nDigital version delisted since 2021"
