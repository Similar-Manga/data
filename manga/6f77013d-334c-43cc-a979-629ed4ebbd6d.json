   "en": "Moriyama is a well-off executive director of a high-class company, with a wife and two children. However, Moriyama isn't all he seems: He is in fact a Zainichi Korean who changed his name and identity after the war to shield himself from discrimination. One night, he is asked by an old friend to shelter a fellow countryman, Jo, who has come for his own reasons. Moriyama, who has distanced himself from his roots until now, must confront not only his heritage, but his past.\n\nA sealed one-shot of Tezuka's focusing on Zainichi Koreans, it has never been recollected or reprinted in any capacity."
