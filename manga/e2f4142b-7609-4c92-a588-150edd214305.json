   "en": "\"You've reached a strange place.\"\nIt came from peaceful Mars!\nA masterpiece along with \"Robot Third Class\" is fully revived for the first time in 50 years!!\n\n[Synopsis]\nWhen Dr. Toppi and his friends were debating whether or not there are Martians on Earth,\nYa-chan, a Martian, arrives on Earth in a rocket!\nThe Earth bursts into laughter at Ya-chan's cosmic jokes. Surrounded by a whirlpool!?\n\n[Commentary]\nThe 23rd collection of Koremitsu Maetani's masterpieces is featuring the famous character \"Hachi-chan\" who ranks alongside \"Robot Third Class\" and \"Goraku Combi\"! This work is a sophisticated story like Rakugo. This work is faithful to Maetani's style, which depicts classic gags and the trends and manners of the time. It is also distinctive that the author himself appears in the work as an important character. I don't know if any of the characters are modeled after real people, and it is still a rare technique for the author himself to appear in the work. This time, it includes episodes serialized in Kodansha's \"Bokura\" and three rental books published by Kotobuki Shobo before the serialization of \"Bokura\"!! Hachi-chan has a completely different reaction from Robot-kun. is a work that will attract attention even if you are not a Maetani fan."
