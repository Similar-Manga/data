   "en": "*Tezuka also did Picture Books in addition to Manga. Unfortunately, these were not collected under the original Manga Complete Works but were reprinted by Kawade Shobo as a 4 Volume set. These are Picture Books based on Fairy Tales his Mother told to him as a child*\n\n(from fukkan.com and **[Tezuka](https://tezukaosamu.net/jp/other/129.html)[Osamu](https://tezukaosamu.net/jp/other/133.html)[.](https://tezukaosamu.net/jp/other/131.html)[net](https://tezukaosamu.net/jp/other/120.html)**):\n\n When Osamu Tezuka was a child, his mother told him many stories. This picture book series was born from those memories. \n\n...4 wonderful stories:\n\n- [**Burn, Dragon!**](https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68326720) (もえよドラゴン, Moeyo Dragon) 1981 - A princess is kidnapped by a bad knight, but a righteous dragon rescues her...\n\n-  [**Sweater Frenzy**](https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68326865) (セーターさわぎ, Seta Sawagi) 1983 - A witch and animals living in a forest in the middle of winter compete for a woolen sweater they found in the forest. The reason is that it was bitterly cold that winter. That is why the witch and the animals wanted to wrap themselves in the sweaters and get snug. But while they were fighting for the sweaters, the yarn frayed and was ruined. What should they do?\n\n- [**Sleeping Beauty**](https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68326721) (いばら姫, Ibarahime) 1985 - This is a well-known Grimm's fairy tale in Japan under the title of \"Ibarahime\". This is a faithful adaptation of the original without any particular alterations by Osamu Tezuka.\n\n- [**Sky-Flying Rabi**](https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68326753) (空とぶラビ, Sora Tobu Rabi) 1988 - Rabbi is an energetic but very wimpy little rabbit. One day, Rabbi was being chased by a mean fox. After running and running and running, Rabbi runs deep into the forest where he meets a mysterious dwarf. The dwarf tells Rabbi, \"Give me your tail and I will make you fly.\" Rabbi gives up his tail to escape from the fox, and the dwarf makes him fly. The animals in the forest see the flying rabbit, and want to fly too, so they rush to the dwarf."
