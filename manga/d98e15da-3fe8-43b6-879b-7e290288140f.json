   "en": "Natsuki's a coffee shop owner who took over his father's business. Akutsu, a regular customer, is a real estate businessman in charge of a redevelopment plan that involves evicting businesses in Natsuki's shopping district. They become adversaries as negotiations continue with the shopping arcade, which explains Natsuki's aloofness toward Akutsu in their daily exchanges. But, one day, they become secretly involved in a way Natsuki never imagined. Akutsu spots Natsuki outside a bar catering to men and notices his hesitation to take the first step. Who would have guessed that he would suggest experimenting with him? So begins a bittersweet, mature game of love between a confident realtor and a coffee shop proprietor who has no experience with relationships."
