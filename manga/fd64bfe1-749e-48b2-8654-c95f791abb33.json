   "en": "\"Naive and easy-going Kousaka is a bartender at a local popular hangout place. One night, a couple–a young mischievous, spirited guy and a rich, handsome and well-groomed man walk in. Kousaka noticed that they seemed a bit odd being together-but little did he know, they weren't there for happy hour drinks! They were there to approach Kousaka and to be a part of their 3-way relationship. When he finally realizes that he is wanted by the two-Kousaka finds himself embroiled in a messy love triangle! Now what will he do? Kousaka wants out of this relationship…or does he?\" (Doki Doki.)  \n  \nA spin-off to Martini Kouryakuhou featuring Kousaka, and a cocktail called \"Side Car\"… This story also introduces two new characters: Kaneshiro Yuuichi and Miyashita Fumi.  \n  \nAlso includes two other stories:  \n  \n- Stinger Kaijuuhou  \n  \n- XYZ Yuuwakuhou"
