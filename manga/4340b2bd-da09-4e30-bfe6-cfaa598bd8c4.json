   "en": "Wait. I’ll do everything. You just stay still. Wataru, who was living completely dependent on his girlfriend, got kicked out of the house when she started looking for a marriage partner. After drowning his sorrows, he falls asleep dead drunk on the side of the road, where he gets picked up by Iori, a Japanese tea ceremony master!! Not only does he make the mistake to attack the beautiful Iori, but he also breaks an expensive vase to top it all off...!!! But for some reason, he ends up becoming a live-in worker at his house... Then one day, Wataru finds Iori playing with his butt by himself. \"Were you jerking off because I wasn’t here?\" Wataru can't control his desire to hold Iori when he sees him looking so sexy...!!"
