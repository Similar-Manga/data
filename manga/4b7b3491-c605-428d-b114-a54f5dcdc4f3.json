   "en": "Deep beneath in the Himalayas live strange creatures known as Zero Men - an highly evolved species of squirrel with superhuman power. Zero Men once lived side by side with mankind, but they were waiting for humanity to destroy itself. \n\nThe high priest of Zero Men society has a plot to invade all other countries on Earth. He sends an agent, Lord Enma, to establish a frontline base for the Zero Men in Japan. \n\nHowever, there are Zero Men who ally with human beings; one of them being Ricky, who was found and raised by humans in Japan. Together with his human friend Pit, they set out to defeat Lord Enma.\n\n---\n**Volumes 21-24 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
