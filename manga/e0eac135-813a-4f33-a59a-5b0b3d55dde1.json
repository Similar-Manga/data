   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nA book titled \"Kaikoku Shinsho\" written by Hiraga Gennai, who supposedly died in prison, has been found! Researcher Yamanouchi and his student, Midori Yuzuriha, who obtained this mysterious old book, decipher it and uncover a series of historical facts that defy common sense! The infamous financial reform of the Shogunate by Iitsugu Tanuma was actually a highly praiseworthy achievement! Is Iiji the politician of the Showa period? This is a human drama that brilliantly interlaces the Edo period and the present day with the skillful direction and cutting expressions typical of Shotaro Ishinomori!"

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
