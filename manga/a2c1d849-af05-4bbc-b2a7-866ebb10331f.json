   "el": "Ο Gol D. Roger, ένας άνθρωπος που αναφέρεται ως «Βασιλιάς των Πειρατών», πρόκειται να εκτελεστεί από την Παγκόσμια Κυβέρνηση. Αλλά λίγο πριν τον θάνατό του, επιβεβαιώνει την ύπαρξη ενός μεγάλου θησαυρού, του One Piece, που βρίσκεται κάπου μέσα στον απέραντο ωκεανό γνωστό ως Μεγάλη Γραμμή. Ανακοινώνοντας ότι το One Piece μπορεί να διεκδικηθεί από οποιονδήποτε άξιο να το φτάσει, ο Βασιλιάς των Πειρατών εκτελείται και η Μεγάλη Εποχή των Πειρατών ξεκινά. Είκοσι χρόνια αργότερα, ένας νεαρός με το όνομα Monkey D. Luffy είναι έτοιμος να ξεκινήσει τη δική του περιπέτεια, αναζητώντας το One Piece και πασχίζοντας να γίνει ο νέος Βασιλιάς των Πειρατών. Οπλισμένος μόνο με ένα ψάθινο καπέλο, μια μικρή βάρκα και ένα ελαστικό σώμα, ξεκινά ένα φανταστικό ταξίδι για να συγκεντρώσει το δικό του πλήρωμα και ένα άξιο πλοίο που θα τους διασχίσει τη Μεγάλη Γραμμή για να διεκδικήσει τη μεγαλύτερη θέση στην ανοιχτή θάλασσα.",
   "en": "Gol D. Roger, a man referred to as the \"Pirate King,\" is set to be executed by the World Government. But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line. Announcing that One Piece can be claimed by anyone worthy enough to reach it, the Pirate King is executed and the Great Age of Pirates begins.  \n  \nTwenty years later, a young man by the name of Monkey D. Luffy is ready to embark on his own adventure, searching for One Piece and striving to become the new Pirate King. Armed with just a straw hat, a small boat, and an elastic body, he sets out on a fantastic journey to gather his own crew and a worthy ship that will take them across the Grand Line to claim the greatest status on the high seas."
