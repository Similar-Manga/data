   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nMangaka Tetsuya Chiba was watching a construction site from his work space on the second floor and was moved by the people sweating and working under the sun. He recalled the year 1945--the year of Japan's defeat in the war--when he escaped from Manchuria to return to his homeland, Japan. He wrote \"The Picture Book Artist in the Attic\" about his childhood experiences. This is a collection of three other essays, including \"The Road Home 1945-2003\" and \"Chiba Pro Big Riot: The Weasel of Nerima\".\n\n*CDJapan link for the second oneshot only.*"
