   "en": "Edogawa Ranpo's masterpiece short stories \"The Man Who Travels with Oshie,\" \"The Air-raid Shelter,\" \"The Red Room,\" and \"Dr. Mera\" are beautifully depicted by Kanako Inuki, the queen of horror manga! The entire story is told from Dr. Merahakase's point of view, a fresh and original approach to this book of her best work! The long-awaited unpublished work is finally available in e-book format! At first glance, the man looks to be around 40 years old, but upon closer inspection, he appears to be an old man of 60 or more, holding up a painting and murmuring something to himself. The old gentleman said that he was traveling with the oshie and was showing him the scenery. The oshie he showed me was so strange... (from \"The Man Traveling with the Oshie\" in Volume 1) The air raid alarm sounds and the town quickly becomes quiet. In the distance, the sound of anti-aircraft guns can be heard, which gradually move closer and closer. I stop and look up at the sky, and apart from the fear, I find an irresistible beauty. What is love under extreme conditions in an air-raid shelter in the midst of the Tokyo Air Raid... (from the work \"Air-raid shelter\" in volume 2)"
