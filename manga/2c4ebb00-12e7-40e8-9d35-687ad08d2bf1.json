   "en": "A collection of oneshots by Hatsuharu, including I Wake Up With Your Kiss, Love Equation, The Flower That Blooms Within You and Me, and Our Sound.  \n  \nWake Up With Your Kiss  \nI have been looking after the helpless Haru for many years now as a childhood friend. He can't take care of himself, yet he's talented at soccer. I always watch senpai, who I have a crush on, while also keeping an eye on Haru. I don't want senpai to misunderstand my relationship with Haru…  \n  \nLove Equation  \nI love studying, but a classmate has told me that I should take interest in love as well. Then, there's this certain boy that persistently begged for my assistance in order to tutor him, as he seems academically challenged. Reluctantly, I accepted, spending my spare time with him tutoring at the library. As I tutor him and at the same time, getting more acquainted with him, I start to have these unknown feelings for him…  \n  \nThe Flower That Blooms Within You and Me  \nI'm a very popular girl at school that makes any guy's heart flutter. I have yet to meet an interesting guy, until I encountered a certain member of the gardening club…  \n  \nOur Sound  \nI think everyone has their own tempo. Mine happens to be slower than others, which does often get me in trouble. On the other hand, Fujishima-kun, a classmate of mine is a somewhat opposite to myself, where he is often energetic. When I heard a beautiful sound from a piano, I was surprised that it was Fujishima-kun himself that was the player. Ever since then, I was closer to him than ever before…"
