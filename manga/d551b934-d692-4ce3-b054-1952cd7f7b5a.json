   "en": "\"I want you to fall for me.\" Higher-schooler Minato is having a spate of bad luck: getting dumped by his lover, losing his wallet, and getting water poured on his head… He meets a younger student, Hanamura, in the library, who is attractive, but hard to read. Minato, who hasn't gotten over his broken heart, agrees to go on a date with Hanamura as a distraction from his feelings. It was supposed to be a trial date, but ends up bringing the two closer. What lies in wake of the love that blossoms between them…? This is a sweet story about the clumsy romance between a junior who wants to believe in love and a senior trying to mend his broken heart."
