   "en": "***Winner of the 25th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for \"Short Story!***\n\nA highly discussed and polarizing work that delves into marital issues, sparking major media reactions!\n\n*Why is my wife angry...?*\n\nA husband who thought he was living a peaceful life with his wife, daughter, and son as a typical four-person family suddenly finds himself in an unspoken crisis. One day, his wife stops talking to him. Days turn into weeks, and eventually, this wordless existence stretches into six years. There's no memory of a major fight, and household chores and childcare continue as usual. The only difference? Beyond the bare minimum of necessary communication, his wife doesn't speak to him at all.\n\nOriginally serialized to great acclaim on the *Yomitai* website, this much-anticipated book includes the shocking final chapter written exclusively for this release."
