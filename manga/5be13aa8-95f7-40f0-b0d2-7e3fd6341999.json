   "el": "Το \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Μονομάχος\" είναι το κομμάτι της αγγλικής έκδοσης Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, το οποίο δεν κυκλοφόρησε στο περιοδικό Shonen Jump. Συμβαίνει όταν η πλοκή μετατοπίστηκε σε ιστορίες που σχετίζονται κυρίως με τις τερατομονομαχίες. Ενώ τα ιαπωνικά manga συνέχισαν την αρίθμηση κανονικά και διατήρησαν το όνομα Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist ξεκίνησε την αρίθμηση τόμων και κεφαλαίων από το 1.\n\nΤο πρώτο κεφάλαιο είναι το Duel 60 στο ιαπωνικό manga. Ο τόμος 1 του Duelist είναι ο τόμος 8 του ιαπωνικού manga. Η πλοκή περιέχει το αρχικό σενάριο για τα \"Βασίλειο των μονομάχων\", \"Τέρατα και Ζάρια \", \"Πόλη της Μάχης\" και \"Τελικοί του Τουρνουά\".",
   "en": "Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist is the portion of the English Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, which was not serialized in the Shonen Jump magazine. It occurs when the plot shifted to mainly Duel Monsters related storylines. While the Japanese manga continued numbering as normal and kept the name Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist started numbering volumes and chapters from 1.\n\nThe first chapter is Duel 60 in the Japanese manga. Volume 1 of Duelist is Volume 8 of the Japanese manga. The plot contains the original script for the \"Duelist Kingdom\", \"Dungeon Dice Monsters\", \"Battle City\" and \"Tournament Finals\" arcs."

     "en": "Born Kazuo Takahashi in Tokyo on October 4, 1961, for much of his childhood he was a fan of manga and anime such as Tiger Mask, Ultraman, Mazinger Z, and Devilman. In his youth his teacher called him “the poop machine that knows nothing except eating, sleeping and pooping”, which insulted him so much that he decided to become a mangaka in retaliation. He started submitting manga to Shogakukan under the pen name Hajime Miyabi in 1981 and to Kodansha using his real name in 1986, but suffering from extreme poverty he decided to try his hand at Shueisha instead. Inspired by the D’Arby battles in Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, he started writing the gaming manga Yu-Gi-Oh in 1996, which quickly ballooned into a massively popular franchise and one of the most popular trading card games in the world. \n\nAfter completing Yu-Gi-Oh in 2004, in lieu of resting on his laurels, Takahashi-sensei continued to work behind the scenes. Acting as supervisor for the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise, he provided ideas and character designs for its sequel series such as Yu-Gi-Oh GX and Yu-Gi-Oh 5D’s, as well as monitoring their manga adaptations. He was no slouch on his own, either - he made a short series The Comiq in Weekly Shonen Jump in 2018, and in 2019 he partnered with Marvel to release Secret Reverse on Jump+, a short series about Spider-Man and Iron Man fighting a game-loving supervillain. In fact, Takahashi-sensei loved American comics - Hellboy was his favorite, and its author Mike Mignola even did a collaboration with Takahashi-sensei. \n\nOn July 4, 2022, Takahashi-sensei drowned off the coast of Okinawa while snorkeling (apparently a favorite pastime of his). According to eyewitnesses, he was assisting in the rescue of three others who were caught in a rip current.\n\n"
