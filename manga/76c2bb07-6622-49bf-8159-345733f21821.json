   "en": "In the far off the future, man has lived for his own selfish, personal gain. Ignoring the demands of God, mankind is brutally punished by from the skies during an event known as \"The Calamity\". With half of humanity eradicated, clans of males and females soon rise and become separatist. The male led kingdom of Zod fight tirelessly against the kingdom of Halwatat - a misandrist matriarchy where men are deemed both inferior and bringers of every form of destruction. Maraya, a warrior princess and soon to be queen of Halwatat, is banished from her kingdom due to the machinations of her rival Deborah after a misunderstanding. Will Maraya be received back into her kingdom? Or will she find out the true meaning behind \"The Calamity\"?"
