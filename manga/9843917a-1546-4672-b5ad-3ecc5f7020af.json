   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\n Musashi (Takezo) was born in Miyamoto Village, Sangan County, Mimasaka Province (Okayama Prefecture), and spent his days being bullied by his stepmother. Taking advantage of his strength, he was a nuisance in the village, committing all kinds of violent acts. \n\n One day, he is captured and punished by the monk Sozen of a nearby temple. Musashi was told by the monk that his strength was the strength of a monster, not a human being, and set off on a journey in search of what true strength was. \n\n  Shotaro Ishinomori vividly depicts the tumultuous life of Miyamoto Musashi!"

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
