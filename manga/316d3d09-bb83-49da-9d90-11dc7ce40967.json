   "en": "Following a disastrous encounter with a noble, Myne finally resolves to say goodbye to her family and friends in the lower city, changing her name to “Rozemyne” and beginning her new life as the adopted daughter of Ehrenfest’s archduke. However, her days as an archnoble in noble society are brutal, as she is put through rigorous etiquette and magic training on top of her duties as High Bishop and forewoman. It all proves too much for a weak little seven-year-old girl… Or it would have, had the High Priest not offered her the keys to the temple’s book room as a reward. If she could get her hands on those, she’d be able to read all sorts of precious books! Her name may have changed, but Rozemyne’s passion for books remains the same as she charges into a whole new world! The detailed setting expands as the printing industry grows in size. Here begins Part 3 of this biblio-fantasy for book lovers everywhere!"

     "en": "Kazuki began crafting novels during her second year of junior high. After successfully navigating an entrance exam, she entered a national university. However, the demands of work interrupted her writing pursuits. It wasn't until she married and her child started kindergarten that Kazuki found herself with more free time, allowing her to rekindle her passion for writing. In 2013, she commenced publishing her novel \"Ascendance of a Bookworm\" on the user-generated platform Shōsetsuka ni Narō, achieving notable success. By 2015, she officially debuted with the same series under the T.O. Books imprint.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, she wrote a series of essays for \"Everyone's Library\" (みんなの図書館, Minna no Toshokan), a journal released by The Society of Study on Library Problems. \n\nSupport the Author:\n[Ascendance of a Bookworm: Light Novel](https://j-novel.club/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm)\n[Ascendance of a Bookworm: Manga](https://j-novel.club/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-manga)\n[Ascendance of a Bookworm: Fanbook](https://j-novel.club/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-fanbook)\n[Ascendance of a Bookworm: Short Story Collection](https://j-novel.club/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-short-story-collection)\n[Ascendance of a Bookworm: Royal Academy Stories - First Year](https://j-novel.club/series/ascendance-of-a-bookworm-royal-academy-stories-first-year)\n\n\n"
