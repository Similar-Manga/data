   "en": "As a child, Mamiya Sakura mysteriously disappeared in the woods behind her grandma's home. She returned whole and healthy, but since then, she has had the power to see ghosts. Now a teenager, she just wishes the ghosts would leave her alone! At school, the desk next to Sakura's has been empty since the start of the school year. Then one day her always-absent classmate Rokudo Rinne shows up, and he's far more than what he seems! After school one day, Rinne helps Sakura deal with the ghost of a boy who has a crush on her. Rinne, it seems, knows just how to handle such ghosts, and has the skills and tools to properly dispatch them to the afterlife (for a small fee of course). Sakura starts to learn more about her mysterious classmate, and her curiosity about Rinne draws her deeper into the amazing world between life and death.  \n\n\n---\nOfficial Release:\n- English release by [Viz Media](https://www.viz.com/rin-ne)\n- Indonesian release by Elex Media as **Circle of Reincarnation Rinne**\n\n\n  \nThe following links are to AnimeNewsNetwork for the anime:  \n[Season 1](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=16546)  \n[Season 2](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=17656)  \n[Season 3](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18755)"

Her works are popular worldwide, where they have been translated into a variety of languages, with over 200 million copies in circulation. She has won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice, once in 1980 for Urusei Yatsura and again in 2001 for Inuyasha, and the Seiun Award twice, once in 1987 for Urusei Yatsura and again in 1989 for Mermaid Saga.

In 2020, the Japanese government awarded Takahashi the Medal with Purple Ribbon for her contributions to the arts.\n\nShe enrolled in Koike Kazuo’s Gekiga Sonjuku as one of inaugural students along with Yamamoto Atsuji, Akane Koka, Caribu Marley, Sakuma Akira, Kikuchi Hideyuki, Kudo Kazuya, Kataoka Tetsuji, Shiki Takashi, Tanaka Akio, Saotome Masayuki, Miyaoka Hiroshi and Takeda Masatoshi.\n\nKamiyo Akimine, Shimizu Aya, Chiba Konami, Fujisawa Moyashi and Saito Kuniko were once her assistants.\n\nTakahashi once had a meeting with Sakuma and Toriyama Akira about a collaboration work, but it seems it ended up with only Sakuma and Toriyama participating in the joint project."
