   "en": "Sakura is a princess who lives alone with a few maids in a mansion deep in the mountains. She’s been betrothed to the prince of the country since she was born. She doesn’t like that fact, as she wants to decide her fate on her own. However, on the night of their marriage, Sakura finds out that she is the granddaughter of the legendary Princess Kaguya, and that her lifelong task is to exterminate youkos, man-eating mononoke. In doing so, she creates allies and enemies who both want her on their side."
