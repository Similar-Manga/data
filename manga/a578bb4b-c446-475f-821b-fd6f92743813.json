   "en": "In the world of shinobi, the Book of Yamato-jinten is a scroll worthy of ruling over the world. Hattori Hanzo Masanari plots to recapture the \"Wajinten no Tori\" that was held by Sarutobi Sasuke. In July 1987, Ninta, a fifth-year student at Aobadai Elementary School, was practicing ninjutsu with his mother being the 21st head of the Sarutobi family, Oshimi. And beyond time, Sasuke lurked inside Shinobu and possessed the \"Wajinten no Tome\". Hanzo sends his son Kazumasa and an American Kunoichi Rola as assassins, but not only are they no match for them, but they also become good friends with Ninta. Knowing that Sasuke will appear when Ninta is in trouble, Hanzo sends powerful enemies such as Hakuunsai into the present age. Still frustrated with Hanzo who can't get the book back, the Magen clan invites Sarutobi and his party into the Magen world. Shinobu and the others face off against Genyo Koji at the Illusion Castle, where it becomes clear that there are two types of \"Book of the Gods of Yamato\": Book One and Book Two. In a dream, Ninta learns that the Second Book is with his classmate Akiha Nakabayashi."
