   "en": "From Fantasy Shrine:  \n1) Your prisoner: “I’m afraid he’s your type,” says the boss to the number one host of Club Pierce, Kusakabe Daiki, referring to his mysterious rival, Shiina Masaki… Does the night club power struggle involve a tussle with the bodies?!  \n  \n2) Look at me with your eyes closed: A year ago, Asara was gang raped by a group of people who bought a night with him through an online auction made by his boyfriend. Now he is going out with a new guy, but this person reminds him of someone.  \n  \n3) Double crash: Hirotaka got injured in a car accident during a challenge against Ryo and had to give up on street races. After the accident Ryo, feeling indebted, insisted on wanting to take care of Hirotaka but is it only for his sense of guilty that he began to sleep with him?  \n  \n7) Yours: Continuation from the first chapter"
