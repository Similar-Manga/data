   "en": "The soccer club that Shingo and others belong to, who are in the fourth grade of Sakura Elementary School, has set an infamous record of 49 consecutive losses, so it is decided to disband. Akira, the female manager, proposed to create a new soccer club for only 4th graders, and she arranged a practice match against last year's district tournament winning team \"Dantods\". Shingo and others, who had lost their passion for soccer, were inspired by Akira's enthusiasm and decided to stand up again, and Akira joined as the 11th member! A refreshing youth soccer story depicting the growth of the new team \"The Vikings\" centered on the female striker Akira, who mixes with the male club members and chases the ball recklessly!"
