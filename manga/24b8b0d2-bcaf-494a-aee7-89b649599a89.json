   "en": "Director Shinji Higuchi also praises!! The \"phantom\" Uchiyama Mamoru version of Ultraman has been released as a full-scale book for the first time in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Ultraman series!!\n\nUltraman, an immortal hero born in Japan. Mamoru Uchiyama's version of \"Ultraman\" comics (\"The Return of Ultraman\", \"Ultraman A\", \"Ultraman Taro\", and \"Ultraman Leo\"), which were very popular serialized in the school year magazine \"Elementary Grade 2\" from 1971 to 1974, are Tsuburaya Productions. In commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Ultraman series, the first full-scale publication has been realized at once!\nThe first installment is \"The Return of Ultraman\" (1971).\nIts smart and elegant character design, speedy development, and powerful dynamic battle scenes are truly unique to Mamoru Uchiyama's version. The brave appearance of Hideki Go and the MAT members, the many monsters and mechas, and the great success of Ultraman that made the boys heartbroken that day... 40 years later, they are back!\nThe series, which was praised as \"one of the best masterpieces\" among the many Ultraman comicalized works, was only released as a convenience store comic in the mid-2000s (already sold out) after being published in a magazine, and is now difficult to obtain. It is a rare work of “phantom”, and fans have been eagerly waiting for a full-fledged book in a cohesive form.\nDirector Shinji Higuchi is also enthusiastic! (=Recommendation comments below) The same work, which is very popular even in our unique system \"reissue request\", will be specially published to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Tsuburaya Pro's Ultraman series. This is your chance to collect all four great masterpieces in an affordable form.\nIn addition to recording all the episodes serialized in the monthly magazine, including all the cover art from the magazine serialization, a new interview with Mamoru Uchiyama and a mini message comic (new) by Mamoru Uchiyama will also be included. Stay tuned!!\n\n●New interview with Mamoru Uchiyama ●A mini-message manga (new) by Mamoru Uchiyama will be included. -Recorded episodes ([Elementary School 2nd Grade] May 1971 issue to April 1972 issue): [Decisive!
