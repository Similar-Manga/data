   "en": "Mikado Hideo, who died in an accident, was reincarnated in another world as Lars Irving, the second son of a fallen aristocrat. Mikado was not loved by his family in his previous life, but in this life and world he was doted on by his parents and older brother and lived happily. He was criticized for his “super jack-of-all-trades”, which he received at the age of 5, as a “missing skill”, but his family doesn’t care and lives a carefree life. One day, he learns that his father was a former feudal lord. As he continued to investigate, Lars suspected that the current lord’s trap had ruined him, and he began to take action to return his parents former title. The “super jack-of-all-trades”, which was thought to be a lost skill, turned out to be a cheat skill, and Lars was embroiled in a big incident. The struggle of the ruined nobles who strive to solve the case with the failing skill “Super jack-of-all-trades” now begins!"
