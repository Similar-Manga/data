This time, the person he likes is his friend, Ari. Ari agrees to go out with him, thinking that he'll get tired of it if she does, and they'll go back to being friends. But will it really turn out that way…?  \n  \n- I Miss  \nAfter one of Ninomiya Majyu's girl friend declines to go to a live concert with her due to certain circumstances,  \nMakyu's new guy friend Aoi Kou asks if he can go with Majyu instead.

But what's this? Mai might have more then just sisterly feelings for her brother?  \nAnd why is Majyu's heart starting to hurt so much when she sees them together, when she shouldn't care in the first place?  \nAn uncomplicated story about jealousy, obsession, forbidden love, and a little courage about ones feelings.  \n  \n- Line Heart  \nMafuyu has always looked after Yuna, even now when they're both in high school. She's always listened to Yuna and done everything for her… Until she met him…  \n  \n- Melody S  \nFollowing a painful break up, she is consoled by his beautiful piano playing. The following day, she is moved by his passion… She must know more about him!  \n  \n- Guuzen ka Unmei ka + a  \nA short 7 page continuation of the the first story, where Ren-kun and Ari are at a fireworks festival, and Ari suddenly disapears on Ren."
