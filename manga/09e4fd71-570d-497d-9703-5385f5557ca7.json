   "en": "The time is Taisho era (1912-1926). Chiharu was born as the eldest daughter in a landowner's family, but she had a \"secret.\" It was a large birthmark covering her back. She was turned down by her father on numerous occasions because of the birthmark, and was unable to find a suitable groom until she reached the spring of her 28th year. Then, her father took her to a party, where she met a man named Seta. When I asked her about him, she told me that he was a womanizer who had made his fortune in a \"bad business.\" But what is he doing? \"I'm here to pick you up, Chiharu-san?\" It is Seta who demands that she marry Chiharu in exchange for covering his father's debts after his business fails. The clumsy marriage between the two. The Taisho married couple romance begins!"
