   "en": "Lumina lost her parents and was left only both alone with her step-younger sibling.\n\nAfter only being taken advantage of by her relatives who were aiming for her family’s fortune, she met a horrific death, but…\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, she was back to 12 years old when her parents died!\n\n‘My relatives are doing well? I can’t bear to see it.’\n\nAs she vowed revenge on her relatives, she visited the Hart family, the most transcendental family in the Empire and the villain family, and confidently asked for support.\n\n“You said you can heal my son?”\n\n“Yes, I will heal the Young Lord!”\n\nHow is it possible, you ask?\n\nIt’s because I’m a healer, and the one and only medicine of the transcendents!\n\nHowever, the regressing situation is a bit strange?\n\n“Why are you so kind to Older Sister?”\n\nMy younger brother, who felt awkward, had a massive misunderstanding without knowing that I was plotting behind him,\n\n“As expected, it will be nice for you to celebrate a wedding with my son.”\n\nI have won the villain’s heart more than necessary.\n\nTo the extent that I become the daughter-in-law of the villain family!\n\n***\n\n“Since the contracted period has expired and it was a forcibly pushed marriage, now for the divorce…”\n\n“You know that I can’t live without you, don’t you. But a divorce?”\n\n“…”\n\n“Do you want to see me going crazy?”\n\nWhat’s even worse, after saving my husband, who was originally destined to die, he is obsessed with me.\n\nI said that my goal after revenge is to live a minimalist life!"
