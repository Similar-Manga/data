   "en": "A modern age where magic exists. In this world, cats understand human language and exist as human neighbors who are \"both intelligent\". And there was a legendary existence that was handed down among cats. That is the existence of the \"King\" who stands at the top of all creatures, called the \"Magical Progenitor\". The existence of the only \"cat that can use magic\" among cats that cannot use magic. The cats called it \" King of Cats \".\n\nA wanderer's journey Nekosero came to a town in search of the \"King's Treasure\" that was told in the legend of cats. It was secretly buried in the backyard of a house. Then Cyril meets the eldest son of the family, the impudent elementary school student Gogaku Osamu .\n\nCyril has dug up a treasure, but unfortunately Osamu sees the scene, and as a result, they get into a fight. In the end, Osamu's older sister Sonoko intervenes and puts an end to the fight, and Cyril reveals the existence of the treasure to Sonoko, Osamu, and Osamu's childhood friend Komako , who happened to be there.\n\nA magic machine ( law machine ) that chased Cyril broke in there. Kanagaki , Cyril's old acquaintance, was in control of the law machine, and was plotting to obtain the \"King's Treasure . \" At the end of the slapstick between Cyril and Law Machine, Osamu wears one of the \"King's Treasures\", the \" Nekokan \", on his head. Then, a woman wearing a cat-shaped mask jumped out of one of the treasures that was stored with the cat crown.\n\nCyril looks at the woman and yells \" Cat Goddess \". When she sees Osamu, she gives a \" crown kiss \" to the cat crown he is wearing due to a misunderstanding caused by her wakeful sleepiness. In other words, it meant that Osamu was chosen as the cat goddess and became the new \"King of Cats\". Cyril panics at the fact (that humans have become kings of cats), and she is astonished.\n\nHowever, Cyril picks himself up and tells Osamu to fulfill his duties and responsibilities as the \"King of Cats\". It meant listening to the wishes of all living things on earth and working forever for the happiness of all living things.\n\nOnce a person becomes the \"King of Cats\", their souls are magically linked to the cat's crown, making it impossible to remove it. Even if he dies, the spell cast on his soul cannot be undone, and he is forced to remain the \"King of Cats\" for nearly 100 years. Osamu, who was a naughty boy, was shocked by this fact, but with the advice and support of Cyril, Sonoko, Komako, and the cat goddess, he became a kind-hearted boy who is compassionate to all living things as the \"King of Cats\". It will grow."
