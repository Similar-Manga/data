   "en": "Collection of oneshots. Very steamy!  \n  \n1) kimi dake ni kikoeru  \nWhen violated by the perverted school doctor, Mizuru calls out the name of his best friend Natsura. But it's his best friend, he can't possibly be in love with him…right?! With Natsura being mute and Mizuru not being true to his real feelings, will these best friends have a happy (and smex-filled) ending?  \n  \n2) ai wa karada de kataru mono  \nIbuki has known that he is different from other boys since he was 12, but he has been able to keep it a secret. However, his dad's new Italian apprentice (who wants to bathe together!) is about to shatter Ibuki's resolve!  \n  \n3)  \nHachiya always felt Hozumi's eyes on him in high school, but never talked to him. Now they meet 8 years later in a gay pub but is it just coincidence? Or destiny?  \n  \n4)  \nTakashina has an imaginary friend name Michael…an imaginary sex friend that is! But he wishes to fall in love with a real man. Maybe his friend Toriumi could be of assistance?  \n  \n5)  \nOkabe is an artist who doesn't go out much. The first man he fell in love with is getting married soon, what is this difficult feeling? In comes Akiyo, a gay janitor who touched one of Okabe's sculptures. Can this straightforward and simple man show Okabe the world outside of his easel that he's been longing to see?  \n  \n6) Our Sin  \n  \n7) Lovesick Baby"
