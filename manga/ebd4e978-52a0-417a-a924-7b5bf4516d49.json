Sayuri Ninomiya, an arrogant young lady with wealth and power at her disposal, is enjoying her youth. She doesn't know that she is destined to become homeless and destitute in just a few years.\n\nBut in the midst of her days of trampling on others, she was still seen as a kind person, even though she was acting rudely. She encouraged other people's self-realization, and even acted as the catalyst for love!\n\nThe story of Sayuri's past life is revealed, as seen by drivers, housekeepers, and teachers!"
