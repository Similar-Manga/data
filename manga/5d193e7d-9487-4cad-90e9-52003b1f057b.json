   "en": "The time is the near future, a time when space development is flourishing, with permanent stations being built on the moon and in satellite orbit . As the existing Space Shuttle became obsolete, a new generation shuttle, the Saratoga class, was built and put on a test flight, but engine trouble caused by the new ship led to a runaway accident and the ship headed for a collision course with the moon at full speed. Although it narrowly avoided a collision with the moon, it is now on a course to enter the sun. Although the spacecraft narrowly avoided entering the sun by using what little fuel it had left, the crew recovery plan failed due to a microsecond synchronization error, leaving everyone involved in despair.\n\nMeanwhile, the seven crew members, including children, did not give up hope, commandeered an old shuttle used to transport supplies to the Earth-orbiting space station, and chased the Saratoga as it headed away from Earth.\n\nThe Saratoga crew was successfully retrieved after overcoming NASA 's chase after the shuttle was stolen and a system failure when the oxygen supply door was unable to open in an area isolated from other cabins. She returns to Earth. Captain Karl saw the children acting so naturally in his role assignment that he named them among the first seven accepted into space.\n\nEighteen years later, they were all involved in space in their respective capacities."
