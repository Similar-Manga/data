   "en": "A masterpiece baseball manga based on the original work by Masaki Tsuji, the novelist who created masterpieces such as the \"Lost Dog Lupine\" series and the \"Travel Writer Shin Uryu\" series, and illustrated by Toshio Shoji of \"Cycle Guy\" .\n\nIchitaro Watari, the ace of the Higashida Elementary School baseball team who has a special move called magic ball tatsumaki, partes ways with Hajime Todoroki, a famous catcher with whom he has been a battery for many years, due to the division of elementary schools. No matter how many magic balls are thrown, unless there is a catcher who can catch them, the magic balls cannot be thrown. So, the manager was looking for a new catcher, but the only people who applied were half-hearted. Moreover, the schedule for the match against Todoroki was approaching soon. Will a catcher who can catch the magic ball appear?"
