   "en": "Mariko, codenamed \"Rose Marie\", is a division leader in the private anti terrorist group C.A.T.   \nShe lost her husband and son in a terrorist attack at an airport; after being injuried in the blast \nshe was left with a scar that looked like a rose flower on her chest, determined to do \neverything in her power to avenge their deaths and prevent other tragedies like hers.  \nThe manga follows her all-woman division's feats and challenges (both military and private) \nfrom the 1980s to the 1990s, a time of instability and change."
