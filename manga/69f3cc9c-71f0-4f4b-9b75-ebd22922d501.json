Tetsuhito starts thinking about things, and wondering if he can get erect for Makoto too… well there's only one way to find out, right?  \nNote: They are both high school students, even though Makoto acts+talks like a child, so this ain't shotacon.  \n  \n2. I'm Thinking About  \nMatsushita-sensei tells his lover, and student, Atsushi not to come over until exams are done. The separation proves to be harder than Matsushita thought…  \n  \n3.

Despite Tsukasa's reservations, he went along with it, but then Hideomi's shocking declaration of \"I want to try having sex\"?! And on top of that, a confession…?!  \n  \n4. Look In  \nMayama's in trouble. Okabe caught him staring… and confronted him about it, asking if he's gay.

But when Tomoya, his home-tutor student, professed his love for him at first sight, Mizuno finds it hard to stick to his plan. Will Tomoya's feelings get through to the Mizuno's locked-up heart?  \n  \n6. Knight Applicants  \nMasato is prince at his school as well as being the student council president. His guard is his loyal childhood friend and Vice President, Kei. Masato confesses that he has someone he likes, although it's one-sided.

Moon's Magic  \nIt is often said that long, long ago, the moon and cats had a very intimate relationship… But what exactly does that mean?  \n  \n8. Referred to You  \nFumio's grandfather liked to collect strange objects. Among these was a lamp that one day Fumio decided to clean. An adorable genie appears, saying that he will grant Fumio three wishes. Fumio's first two wishes come and go accidentally, but he decides on a kiss from his favourite poster girl to be his third wish.
