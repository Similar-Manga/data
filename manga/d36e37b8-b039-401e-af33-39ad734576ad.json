   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nThe world is truly in the age of commercials!　Depending on the advertisement, even black can be made to look like white. Shogoro Tobita, who dreams of becoming a cool CM guy, joins \"Jun Advertising (Ad) Center\" located under the building of the largest company in the industry, \"Daidenpoin\" (......). The company building is a shambles, the president is a super weirdo, and the only employees are Komako Sugo, a beautiful secretary with a zoo dialect, and a senior monkey named Copy!　How can such a company survive?　A nonsense gag serialized in \"Weekly Shōnen Sunday\" in 1970!"

Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
