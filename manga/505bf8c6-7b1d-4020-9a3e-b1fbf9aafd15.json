   "en": "Now, in the distant Meiji era, there were men called ``Makenshi'' who risked their lives on shogi. Kyosuke Komada was rejected from becoming an apprentice at a sumo stable\ndue to his petite physique. However, he had a shogi skill that has never been beaten by anyone! Kosuke, who was convinced that he had no enemies in Tokyo, suffers his first defeat in a match against Hyogo Ayanokoji, a disciple of Gohei Ono, the 12th Master. After that, he continues to lose in matches against serious swordsman Masa with a Noh mask and literary writer Rohan Koda, and his pride is shattered. The person who took care of Kosuke was a female serious swordsman called Ryuu. The story of “Yanke no Kasuke”\nwho ran like a meteor begins now!"
