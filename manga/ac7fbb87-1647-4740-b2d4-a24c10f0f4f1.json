   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nThe Chita family, whose head is a mangaka, lives in Nerima Ward. They have a large family: Mr. and Mrs. Chita, three sons and two daughters, an energetic grandmother living next door, a dog and two small birds. When a new car is delivered to the Chita family, the second and third sons go for a drive to test drive it, and unfortunately, they hit a cat crossing the road...what a disaster! The cat was a cat that had joined the Chita family by chance (?). The cat, Haneta, and his family joined the Chita family by chance... A slapstick comedy based on a true story that happened to the Chiba family begins!"
