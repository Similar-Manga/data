   "en": "Two short shojo serials:\n\n- **The Rainbow Fortress:** \nMimi, who lives in Bagdad, is the daughter of the leader of 40 thieves. She is also a thief (with the alias Black Cat), although she wishes she and her father could give up that life to live happily with her mother. A jewel known as the Rainbow Fortress is said to materialize any prayer or hope. Mimi's father gets wrapped up in the hunt for the Rainbow Fortress, and she must save him.\n\n\n- **The Spirit of the Wild Rose:** \nJulie's village is split into two opposing camps. Her mother dies due to lack of medical treatment, and her father is captured by soldiers. Julie's stepmother comes to raise her, but treats her terribly. As a result Julie, along with her childhood friend Romy and Sylvia - who she once saved - run off to Paris in hopes of happiness.\n\n---\n**Volume 30 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
