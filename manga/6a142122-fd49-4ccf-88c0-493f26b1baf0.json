   "en": "One day, Hinako Tsujimoto, who was working part-time at a handicraft store while making dolls as a hobby, met a talented figure modeler, Takumi Kugutsu , and became his apprentice almost as an instigator, starting his career as a figure modeler. Kugutsu refuses to take her as a disciple, but he gives in to Hinako's passion and begins to teach her skills little by little. However, the Kugutsu family has been working as a doll maker for generations, and the dolls made by the family are known to those in the know as dolls that create many miracles. Various stories unfold around the miraculous doll."
