   "en": "One day in 1963, a young pitcher, Taro Tsubakirin, suddenly appeared in the Giants' army, which continued to struggle . We will contribute to the victory of the giants while devising a secret ball. In his first year, he contributed to the league championship, and also defeated Nishitetsu in the Japan Series to become the number one giant in Japan. However, in the second year, he broke his shoulder at the end of the season, and the giant missed the championship. In that year's Stove League, trade talks come up. However, in Kyushu, Tsubaki trains under Onodera, a mysterious man, and finally succeeds in devising the \"Devil's Secret Ball\". Due to the interference of his rival Gonsuke and the opposition of other teams, it was almost banned for a while, but in the end it was allowed by the rules by the commissioner's ruling.In the third year, when he expected to return to the ground, he beat his rivals one after another with his secret ball, but he was home run by Chunichi 's Nachi and disappeared. However, he created a new \"Kasumi's secret ball\" and returned to the end of the pennant race, contributing to the victory. However, an excessive burden was placed on his wrist due to the \"Kasumi's Secret Ball\", and an X-ray revealed that he had a malignant tumor on his wrist. Go on and lead your team to victory. At that time, Nachi, who played against him, noticed an abnormality in his wrist, but he challenged the Japan series with Nankai with the encouragement of \"If you want to quit, don't quit on the way and beat Nankai to become the best in Japan.\" Yagyu, Nachi, and other rivals cheering from the stands watch over him, and he pitches in all the games. Immediately after finishing the final game, he suddenly disappears from the stadium without knowing that he was selected as the best pitcher. It should be noted that (coincidentally) in fact, this year, the giant won Nankai as well as this manga, and became the best in Japan, and from the victory in the same year, the giant achieved the glorious V9 . It will be a memorable work in the first year of V9."
