   "en": "The year is 1921, and this is a Tokyo where monstrous steam-powered robots crash a flower-viewing party only to be cut down samurai-style by a young girl in a kimono and traditional hakama pants.  \n  \nIt's eight years after the horrific Demon War, and Japan is a peaceful prosperous place. Meet Ensign Ogami Ichiro, who has just graduated from the Naval Academy. He's assigned to a base in Tokyo, but soon discovers that his headquarters is the Imperial Theater and his first mission is collecting tickets at the gate. He gamely goes about his menial jobs at the theater, surrounded by beautiful girls who seem to know a lot more about what's going on than he does, but he's about to be swept into a roiling world of robots, demons, and hot girls in uniform."

     "en": "Alternative Names: Fujishima Kousuke, 藤島康介\n\nBirth:Jul 7, 1964\nAge:57\nGender:Male\nYears active:1986-Present\nHometown: Chiba Prefecture, Japan\n\nKosuke Fujishima is a Japanese manga artist who first came to public attention as an editor of Puff magazine, his first job after completing high school. Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist [Tatsuya Egawa](https://mangadex.org/author/de33568c-1448-4813-955a-fdafb63ce459/egawa-tatsuya) in the production of the [Be Free!](https://mangadex.org/title/49746f90-d91f-4ae8-a7a3-91b5d89098ca/be-free) manga\n\nIn 1986, he began his first original manga series [You're Under Arrest](https://mangadex.org/title/cb48732c-c607-4612-b6e8-46318051bcf1/taiho-shichau-zo). His second manga series [Oh My Goddess!](https://mangadex.org/title/b973e612-0d54-48f1-844e-9c83c04b009d/ah-my-goddess), also translated as Ah! My Goddess, became Fujishima's most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the Tales series and Sakura Wars.\n\nHe is known for his love of automobiles and motorcycles, and several of his series and their characters reflect this, such as in éX-Driver and [Toppu GP](https://mangadex.org/title/28ee14d0-52ab-402a-a86b-939e6a575574/toppu-gp)\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page. On July 7, 2016, Fujishima confirmed the marriage on his Twitter account.\n\n[YOSHIZUKI Kumichi](https://mangadex.org/author/afca7e03-a6e1-49bf-8775-448da1c8d141/yoshizuki-kumichi) was once his assistant."
