   "en": "(from amazon.jp):\n\nThis is a coming-of-age documentary manga by Kazuhiko Shimamoto, a rare mangaka who can simultaneously depict the \"coolness\" and \"uncoolness\" of a man fighting against fate, featuring the real-life female professional wrestler Manami Toyoda. As the countdown to Toyoda's retirement is underway, the manga has been reprinted for the first time in 23 years!\n\nSince his debut in 1982, he has depicted the \"fighting spirit\" and \"will to move forward\" in various forms, including \" Blazing Transfer Student\" \" Adversity 9\" \" Burning Pen\" and \"Howling Pen\". The manga is based on his own adolescence.\n\nMost of the main characters in his \"burning\" works are male, but there is one female protagonist who shines brilliantly among them.\n\nThat is Manami Toyoda. Manami Toyoda was a real-life female professional wrestler who created an era in the 1990s under the nickname \"Flying Tennyo.\nThe title of the work is literally \"Burning! Women's Pro Wrestling.\n\nThis documentary manga depicts a black-haired girl gritting her teeth and growing by her own will in the ring, the square jungle, the wonderland of battle. It was serialized from the August 1992 extra issue of Weekly Shonen Sunday to the December 1993 extra issue, and is the gold standard of authentic women's pro wrestling manga!\n\nThis spring, Manami Toyoda announced that the 30th anniversary of her debut, which will be held on November 3, 2017 at the Osanbashi Hall in Yokohama, will be her last active match!\n\nThe event was met with an outcry on the Internet from women's professional wrestling fans of the past, and among them was mangaka Kazuhiko Shimamoto! He wrote on Twitter without a pause, \"Well...Toyoda did her best...I have a responsibility to see it through...No, it's not just me, but everyone, everyone⁉\" to the fighting heroine who once played the leading role in his own work.\n\nThis time, what was once published in three volumes in Shonen Sunday Comics imprint has been collected into one very thick volume of about 600 pages! With the addition of various interviews and bonus content, this volume will be published for the first time in 23 years as a love letter from Mr. Shimamoto to Toyoda and the spectators who lived together with her in that passionate era of women's professional wrestling!\n\nProduct specifications: 1 volume / B6 size / softcover / approx. 600 pages (old edition  combined with interviews)"
