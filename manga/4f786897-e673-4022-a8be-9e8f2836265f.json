   "en": "A transfer student, Ozora Koha, lives with his old-fashioned martial arts father. At first glance, the two appear to be straight-laced, but they are a bit of a funny parent and child, as they repeatedly compete for skis. Soon after moving in, the two of them get into a fight with the police, but Otomi, who is their aunt, comes by and manages to get things out of the way. Otomi likes her hard-line father and tries to approach her, but she is a hard-line father who is intent on pursuing martial arts (although there are times when she wobbles at her temptation and almost collapses). ). On the other hand, the hard-liner wins the battle with the handsome and strongest man, Dragon, at the school he transferred to, and suddenly becomes a person of the moment. The dragon swears revenge on the hardliners, but things are heading in a different direction...? The definitive edition of action-based gag manga!"
