   "en": "Shizunami City, Shizuoka Prefecture, a local city facing the sea. A gentle girl, Yumiko, meets a sharp-eyed young man on the beach early in the morning. His name is Shuji Sakamaki. A high school student who goes to the sea whenever he has free time and has an insatiable passion for surfing. When Yumiko realizes that they used to call each other \"Umi\" and \"U-chan\" when they were in kindergarten, Yumiko's heart flutters. On the other hand, Shuji, knowing or not knowing his passionate gaze, was running towards the sea with his board on his shoulders today as well... Youth surfing story with a refreshing sea breeze! Shuji grows up by learning how to carve boards from the manager of his familiar surf shop, \"Take Off,\" and by punching delinquents with all his might. A masterpiece of surfing comics drawn by the genius of sports manga, Takeshi Miya,"
