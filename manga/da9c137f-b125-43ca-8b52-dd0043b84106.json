   "en": "\"Good luck!! Bean punch!\"\nAlthough his body is small, his punches and laughter are heavyweight!\nThe children's boxing manga from the creator of \"Nagashima-kun'' has been made into a book for the first time!!\n\n[Synopsis]\nHeiji Mameyama, also known as \"Mame Punch\", is a third year student in the boxing club.\nHe dedicates himself to boxing while helping out at his family's tofu shop, and competes against his seniors in a school boxing tournament.\n\n[Commentary]\nThis work \"Mame Punch'' is a work by Wachisanpei, a master of children's comedies. It was serialized around the same time as his masterpiece \"Nagashima-kun,'' and it evokes a nostalgic feeling of the Showa era just as much as that work.\nAlthough the settings are different, with the sports handled changing from baseball to boxing and the family barber shop becoming a tofu shop, the family structures and characters are similar, making this a must-see for fans of the Showa era and fans of the Showa manga. I would like you to read and compare it with \"Nagashima-kun.''\n\nThis time, all four volumes will be published for the first time in book form, one volume each month from May 2009.\nPlease fully enjoy Mame Punch's exciting boxing and the peaceful daily life of a Showa family."
