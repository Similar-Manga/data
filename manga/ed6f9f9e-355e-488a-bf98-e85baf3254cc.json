   "en": "Umeko is a housewife who has a happy family with two children and a kind husband, but she tends to be self-conscious and brooding. After the deaths of her father and mother, Umeko plans to rearrange and renovate her parents' house, but she feels uneasy because of a series of unfortunate events, including the injury of her daughter at the family home. At that time, her best friend Akane, who works as a nurse at a large hospital, recommends feng shui to her. In fact, Akane was also impatient with the lack of progress in her relationship with her boyfriend and regularly used telephone fortune-telling. Umeko was skeptical at first, but after an accident, she decides to turn to a feng shui master. Following the feng shui master's advice, Umeko's life is filled with small fortunes, and as she becomes more and more addicted to feng shui, her excessive behavior begins to involve those around her. Her daughter Yuka, who distrusts Umeko, consults Akane without her mother's knowledge, but...this semi-fictional story depicts the turmoil and entanglement of two women who have turned to fortune-telling in the hope of finding happiness."
