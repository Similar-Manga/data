Also, the early works were largely divided into horror novels and sad stories, which is why they were labeled Kuro Otsuichi and Shiro Otsuichi, respectively. Under the name Otsuichi, he mainly writes novels in Shueisha, Kadokawa Shoten (currently KADOKAWA), and Gentosha.\n\nInvited by his editor to audition tests of the film Innocent (2004), by director Oshii Mamoru, he meets his daughter, Oshii Tomoe, whom he married in 2006.\n\nLike Yamashiro Asako (2005) he publishes in Media Factory's ghost story magazine Yu.

He also revealed that he contributed a film essay under the name Yuushi Pillow, a then-unknown alias. In May 2016 issue of the Da Vinci, he also does a talk project in the top three aliases under the title A Miraculous Talk Was Made.\n\nHis style has inspired authors such as Tomoi Hitsuji, recipient of the Kono misuterī ga sugoi! 2012 to Excellence, confessing a fan of Otsuichi.
