   "en": "Sunshine Ikezaki has finally been made into a manga!!\n\nYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!\n\nBroadcasting on the TV Tokyo network \"Cook Ikezaki'' is a candy cooking character from ``Oha Suta''!!\nHe shows off various dishes using candy and solves problems at school!?\n\nThe chaotic development that is not typical of a gourmet manga is just one of the stories of Sunshine Ikezaki!!\n\nThe collaboration manga between Oha Suta and CoroCoro has been turned into a comic!!\n\nSunshine Ikezaki, who is also known as a big fan of manga, has finally turned into a manga!\n\n[Recommended information from the editor] Cook Ikezaki, a project in \"Oha Suta\"! Cook Ikezaki himself had wanted to make it into a manga from the time it first appeared. The author, Chihiro Mizune, saw this and made a fierce attack on the CoroCoro Comic editorial department!! The work has progressed steadily from being read as a one-shot in the Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic, to being serialized in the Bessatsu Coro, and then to being published as a web manga. And finally, it's been made into a comic! It's been quite a while since we made it into a comic as a manga project in collaboration with Oha Star. Please enjoy the harmony of Mr. Ikezaki's gag, which has a sunshine color under his supervision, while also having the touch of Mr. Mikoto's gag and the drawing of the seven changes!!"
