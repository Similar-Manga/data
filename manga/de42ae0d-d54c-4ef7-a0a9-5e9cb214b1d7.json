   "en": "Collection of oneshots:  \n  \n- Sensei, Sotsugyou  \nSoudo sensei has been confessed by a popular third year student. But they're student and teacher, such romance is forbidden, even after he graduates…  \n  \n- Sensei to Atashi to Kento-kun (Sensei, me and Kento-kun)  \nKato Ichika is in love- with Takatsuki sensei! She is so \"in love\" to the point she made an alias in order to \"befriend\" him on twitter, but she has no face to face connection with him. When she foolishly ran into a door, she bumped into a certain kouhai called Kento-kun. From him, she finally has a link to her sensei. Will Ichika be able to successfully capture sense's heart, or will her heart belong to someone else?  \n  \n- Koi ni Ochita Sagishi-kun (Imposter That Fell in Love)  \nHaruto thinks all women are easy. All you have to do is say a few sweet words to them, and they'll adore you, especially if you're handsome. That is why is he a marriage swindler, currently aiming for a certain nurse. Whilst he was meeting her, he encounters a doctor who is the hospital director's daughter, thinking he can, yet again get an even bigger amount of yen from this seemingly innocent doctor. Little did he know about women in general, and especially Ayako, whom he may be falling for?!  \n  \n- Ao no Binetsu Bangai-hen side: Yoshioka  \nAo no Binetsu extra edition side: Yoshioka\n"
