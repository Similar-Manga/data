   "en": "*Delisted from digital retailers as of October 31st, 2019.*\n\n(from ebookjapan):\n1988 was the first year of the Tokyo Dome. In April of that year, a pitcher who could handle a magic pitch suddenly appeared in the world of professional baseball. His name was Dome Shinjo. He was an elementary school boy who belonged to the Yomiuri Giants. He was successful with \"Dome Special No. 1, the disappearing magic ball\" and \"Dome Special No. 2, the boomerang ball,\" which took advantage of the subtle airflow created by the Tokyo Dome's air conditioning, but the pennant race that year ended with the Chunichi Dragons' victory. As the year dawned, Dome took the mound in hopes of winning the championship!"

Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
