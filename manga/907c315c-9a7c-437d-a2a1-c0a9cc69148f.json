   "en": "Sentaro Baba, who was drafted first in the draft seven years ago, appeared for the entrance test for the Redmans, a professional baseball team. At that time, he was a man who refused to join the company because he was inheriting his family's construction company. It was doubtful what would happen to him after a seven-year hiatus, but he passed the exam by hitting a home run. He joined professional baseball in order to rebuild the company by using the money from his contract and the sale of his apartment and foreign car to pay for the retirement benefits of laid-off employees. Sentaro begins his career as both a construction company and a professional baseball player. When he found out that he would not receive the 100 million contract bonus, he changed his plans to play catcher and became a pitcher. 1 win 10 million yen"
