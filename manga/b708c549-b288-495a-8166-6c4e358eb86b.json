   "en": "What if ninjas met baseball!?\nThe exciting ninjutsu baseball manga by Tokiwaso's Terra is republished!\n*Special recording*\n“We were just students at a terakoya school!” Fujiko Fujio (A) 10,000-word interview\n\n[Synopsis]\nSasuke Sarutobi, the 15th Koga ninja, decides to leave the mountains and train in ninjutsu in various worlds based on the advice of his master Hakuun Sai. Sasuke visits Tokyo with his partner, the talking parrot \"Ketchup\", and meets Saizo Kirigakure, a descendant of the Iga ninja who plays for the Giants professional baseball team, and his sister Tsukiko, who learn how to entertain people rather than using ninja techniques to defeat people. I am moved by sports.\nEventually, Sasuke joined the Giants, hit a huge home run in his first appearance, and instantly became popular.\n\n[Commentary]\nThis work, which was serialized in Houbunsha's monthly magazine ``Baseball Boy'' for 21 times starting from the September 1950 issue, is a work that focuses on entertainment, which is unusual among Terada's many works. The story unfolds with plenty of humor, including a young ninja named Jiraiya targeting Sasuke, and a ninjutsu showdown with his rival, Goemon Ishikawa. However, the scene where the main character, Sasuke, stands on the same field as big stars in the baseball world such as Kawakami, Nagashima, and Kaneda and engages in a serious competition, is a great highlight as it reflects Tera's view of manga that values ​​sportsmanship. You could say that.\nNow, enjoy this thrilling work that combines tension and relaxation to your heart's content!"
