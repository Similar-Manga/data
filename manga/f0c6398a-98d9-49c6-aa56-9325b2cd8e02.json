   "en": "Jiro Kuwata has made a comic version of \"Kaiki Daisakusen,'' which was aired on TV by Tsuburaya Productions. Simultaneously includes the phantom \"Gakuen Naushi\" (serialized in Obunsha's third year of junior high school).\n\nBefore our eyes, people turn to bones, a girl who has come out of a painting shoots an arrow, and a legendary vampire comes back to life! The\nmembers of SRI use the power of science to solve the strange phenomena that are moving in the darkness of modern times. A blood-curdling mystery awaits them...\n\n\"Kaiki Daisakusen'', which aired in 1963, is a masterpiece drama in which Tsuburaya Productions, who suddenly became famous with the Ultra series, departed from the monster route and took on the challenge of creating a science horror film that made full use of special effects.\n\nMany manga artists took on the challenge of adapting it into a comic, but among them, Jiro Kuwata's (Jiro Kuwata) version, which was serialized in Shueisha's Shonen Book, was a work that depicts the scientific tricks hidden behind the horror of the original work. , its sharp and linear touch was highly praised.\n\nThe horror of a man-eating moth that melts humans and turns them into bones, a mysterious beautiful girl who escapes from paintings and shoots people, and what happens when her beloved becomes a vampire. Based on episodes from the TV version written by special effects script geniuses such as Tetsuo Kinjo and Moriichi Ichikawa, Jiro Kuwata's well-oiled pen shines through.\n\nSimultaneously recorded is the imaginary bright school comedy \"Gakuen Meishu''.\nPublished for the first time in book form with the cooperation of Obunsha!!"

Even then, Ikegami had the magic touch, and his first two collaborative efforts - I UEO Boy with [Koike Kazuo](https://mangadex.org/author/785c1506-618e-4829-9533-86995c04c0a4/koike-kazuo) in 1973 and Otoko Gumi in 1974 with [Kariya Tetsu](https://mangadex.org/author/4279ea10-bc91-47f9-b7a7-aca12bc4430f/kariya-tetsu) - proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nHe worked at [Mizuki Production/Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140/mizuki-shigeru) as an assistant for about a year and a half. He is a fan of [TSUGE Yoshiharu’s](https://mangadex.org/author/0495ec83-5f94-4b89-af30-5db3238581f1/tsuge-yoshiharu) works, Ikegami was surprised when he saw Tsuge also worked at MIZUKI Shigeru’s place.\n\nIkegami once applied to be an assistant to [SATO Masaaki](https://mangadex.org/author/ec701ae7-65a4-4fcc-884c-bee29d3baaac/satou-masaki) \u0026 [SAITO Takao](https://mangadex.org/author/bc302292-841c-42b1-962d-bcb41d427ae2/saito-takao) but they already had enough assistants at that time.\n\n[FUJIWARA Yoshihide](https://mangadex.org/author/d4bd7c05-4986-424a-99d1-30d7d56daa95/fujiwara-yoshihide), [Akiha @](https://mangadex.org/author/4a3fbf8e-d386-400b-b167-7eb729c44e3d/akiha), MATSUHISA Yuu, and SATA Misaki were once his assistants.\n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=930)"
