   "en": "\\\"I thought I was going to marry this person someday...\\\" Chihiro lives with her lover, Takuma. However, because they hadn't had sex in months, and Takuma doesn't seem to be motivated for marriage, she breaks up with him. Chihiro decides to leave the house, but is unable to find suitable lodgings for her to move in. By Takuma's suggestion, she ends up staying until her new home is found. In such a situation, Chihiro's ideal man, Junpei, appears. They become lovers, but Chihiro is troubled since she can't bring herself to tell him that she's still living with her ex-boyfriend. On the other hand, Junpei also has his own set of problems...\\\""
