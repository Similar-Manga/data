He kills some for fun, to test the effectiveness of his sword blade and to generate a climate of terror that drives other farmers into blind obedience. \n\nThese, increasingly reduced to starvation, are forced to pay higher and higher taxes in rice, extorted from them through coercive methods, the kidnapping of women or the taking of hostages but all their attempts to revolt are suffocated in blood in the bud.\n\nOne day, however, a crippled monk makes his appearance in those lands, who attributes those nefarious events to the curse of the venerable Akame, who in reality are very normal rabbits, the main food of the local population.\n\nThe rabbits thus become the object of the veneration of the peasants, who invoke their protection, which, however, is not frowned upon by the feudal lord..."
