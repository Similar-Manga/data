   "en": "What is \"C coat\"? A fantastic tennis manga serialized in \"Shonen Captain'' by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko of \"Mobile Suit Gundam'' from 1987 to 1988. Published simultaneously with “Reijima Yutan ②” in September, the 4th anniversary of “COMIC Ryu”! A masterpiece that has never been republished among Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's many works! Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's uniquely shocking setting, and the drama's development, which is more than just a sports story, are still interesting to read! Above all, Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's tennis match scenes drawn with powerful strokes are a masterpiece! Includes new drawings!!"
