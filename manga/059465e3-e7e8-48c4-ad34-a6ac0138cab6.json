   "en": "From MangaHelpers:\nIt all started with the suicide of an up and coming female photographer named Hirose Miki. The autopsy revealed that she may have been raped before she threw herself off of the condo balcony. Her fiancé, Kuremi Takeo, a TV producer, is unable to accept her death and begins his own search for the truth of what really happened to Miki. Beginning with one photograph that he finds, Takeo begins to unravel a dark mystery. But the deeper he goes into the abyss, the greater the conspiracy becomes and the more danger he encounters. The thirst for justice and revenge will push Takeo to take on whatever obstacle stands in his way"

     "en": "Associated Names: IKEGAMI Ryouichi, อิเคงามิ เรียวอิจิ, 池上辽一, 池上遼一\n\nBirth Place: Fukui-ken, Takefu, Japan\nBirth Date: May 29, 1944\nZodiac: Gemini \n\nIkegami began drawing his first comic series at the age of seventeen. Even then, Ikegami had the magic touch, and his first two collaborative efforts - I UEO Boy with [Koike Kazuo](https://mangadex.org/author/785c1506-618e-4829-9533-86995c04c0a4/koike-kazuo) in 1973 and Otoko Gumi in 1974 with [Kariya Tetsu](https://mangadex.org/author/4279ea10-bc91-47f9-b7a7-aca12bc4430f/kariya-tetsu) - proved so popular they set the pattern for what would turn out to be one of the manga world's biggest success stories. Although many of his earlier works were written and drawn solo, nowadays Ikegami works almost exclusively with collaborators and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nHe worked at [Mizuki Production/Mizuki Shigeru](https://mangadex.org/author/9a7709d7-c9a6-4afb-bdf9-054aec977140/mizuki-shigeru) as an assistant for about a year and a half. He is a fan of [TSUGE Yoshiharu’s](https://mangadex.org/author/0495ec83-5f94-4b89-af30-5db3238581f1/tsuge-yoshiharu) works, Ikegami was surprised when he saw Tsuge also worked at MIZUKI Shigeru’s place.\n\nIkegami once applied to be an assistant to [SATO Masaaki](https://mangadex.org/author/ec701ae7-65a4-4fcc-884c-bee29d3baaac/satou-masaki) \u0026 [SAITO Takao](https://mangadex.org/author/bc302292-841c-42b1-962d-bcb41d427ae2/saito-takao) but they already had enough assistants at that time.\n\n[FUJIWARA Yoshihide](https://mangadex.org/author/d4bd7c05-4986-424a-99d1-30d7d56daa95/fujiwara-yoshihide), [Akiha @](https://mangadex.org/author/4a3fbf8e-d386-400b-b167-7eb729c44e3d/akiha), MATSUHISA Yuu, and SATA Misaki were once his assistants.\n\nSource: [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=930)"
