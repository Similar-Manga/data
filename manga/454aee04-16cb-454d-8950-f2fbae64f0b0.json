To help him, Asimov-kun rebuilds him as Borottono giving him a samurai-like personality that lessened his earlier naughty personality with help from a slap function installed by Asimov-kun. The manga follows the misadventures of the newly built Borottono as he goes around with his friends in several misadventures."

     "en": "Thanks to the success of Harenchi Gakuen, Dynamic Productions (ダイナミックプロダクション, also known as Dynamic Production or Dynamic Pro, ダイナミックプロ), was founded by [Go Nagai](https://mangadex.org/author/1a76535a-b389-4e42-9130-a71d0ec94611/nagai-go) with his brothers in April 1969. Meant to be a group to help him with his works, as a consequence Harenchi Gakuen, where he derived almost no royalties from the TV series, films, or related merchandise, Dynamic Productions became a company established to manage Nagai's relations and contractual rights of his work. Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
