She is thrilled to have a job that allows her to work on the manga he loves, but in the printing industry her seniors and colleagues are very particular and specific about the details which sometimes leads to her old delinquent personality to leak out!

This is a workplace comedy that describes Yuu Mashiro who is single-minded in everything she does, struggles through the rough and tumble of the printing company, as well as provide readers with a glimpse of the printing industry!"
