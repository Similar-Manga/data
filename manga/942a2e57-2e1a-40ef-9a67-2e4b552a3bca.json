   "en": "It is 1964, and Kozo Inada is a 16 years old boy living in Kumano, Mie Prefecture. He hated his parents, who he saw as enemies because they judged people based on labels. And he couldn't help getting belligerent and demonizing his teachers. As he grew up from a boy to a man, he continued to rebel against the absurdity of adult society during his turbulent adolescence. Based on a true story, this is a fantastic and shocking early work!"
