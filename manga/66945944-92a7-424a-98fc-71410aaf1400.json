   "en": "The warmest thing in the world is being together. Earnest Kara and flippant Nom live in the second coldest town in the world. Though they get along well, they have clashing personalities. On these ordinary days, they sometimes get irritated or fight over the smallest things. Even then, thanks to the small things like meeting reindeer and penguins or Nom catching a cold, Kara starts thinking about what is really important for them to be living together. The reason why you love the person next to you is right there in your everyday life, just waiting to be found."
