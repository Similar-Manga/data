   "en": "A young man, called 'Bin' by his friends, works at his part-time job and lives in an unusual non-blood-related family with three women. The oldest, Touko, is a single woman in her forties who runs a modest bar. She actually owns the house they all live in. Next, Makiko, is a woman in her thirties who works at a life insurance company. She once had her own family, but now she is the only one left. The youngest, Reiko, works desperately hard at a publishing company, where her colleagues seem determined to keep her from success. On the surface, the four of them appear to be a happy family, but Bin is all too aware of the secrets just below the surface.\n\nOne day, Bin runs into a stargazing young woman named Kanako. Kanako is from a particularly short-lived family, and she is desperate to experience life at its fullest before her impending death. She's determined that she wants Bin to be a part of that life, but her violent older brother has other plans. How will Bin successfully navigate his relationships with these four women, and will he ever truly understand love?"
