   "en": "In the early Edo period, Murai Kanjuro was appointed as a military instructor for his impressive figurine cutting skills in the Takami domain of Shinshu, but due to the tactics of someone who was not happy about his success, he was forced to become the lover of his best friend Ryunosuke Kazama. The lord is ordered to take Saori as his wife. He offers to resign on the spot, but is called out for being rude. Kanjuro is confused, but the feudal lord insists that no matter what the reason is, he won't listen to him. After thinking about it, Kanjuro came up with the answer... Wu Laihan, a Han who lives only by relying on his own martial arts! Cut down the great evil that infests the world!! Introducing a macaroni western-style authentic period drama!"
