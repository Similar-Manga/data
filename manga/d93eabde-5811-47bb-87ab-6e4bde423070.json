   "en": "“Just let yourself feel good,” he says as he kisses me in an insatiable manner. His hot member presses against that special place of mine as he grinds against me... How can he be a greengrocer yet be so carnivorous in bed!? Yuuri works at a Japanese bar and recently has been getting constantly teased and played around with by the local greengrocer, Mitoma. He gives her weird nicknames and is mean and she just can’t tell what he is thinking. After he gets her out of a pinch at her bar, she invites him for a drink as thanks. As she is telling him about her worries, she gets a little carried away and knocks him to the ground...! “Don’t cry,” he says as her hear heart relentlessly pounds while his beefy arms wrap around her... This is the first time she’s seen him look so manly...!"
