   "en": "The main character, the \"Prince of the Sea\" and his kind-hearted sister Chima, the prince of an undersea country, stand up against the evil that threatens world peace! The coolness of Hayabusa, her favorite aircraft, is equipped with powerful weapons such as needle and mouse cannons and can fly on land, sea, air, and even into space. There's plenty to see, including immortal robots, aliens, fourth-dimensional people, and other unique enemies! This is an exciting science fiction action film that represents the early career of the series, which began serialization in the first issue of Weekly Shonen Sunday (April 5, 1959). The complete collection includes everything from the Shonen Sunday serialization to the parts later drawn in Shogakukan's school year magazine."

Throughout their career they won many individual and collaborative awards, and are best known for creating the popular and long-running series Doraemon, the main character of which is officially recognized as a cultural icon of modern Japan.
