   "en": "The story revolves around a boy named Lamune, who loves to play video games. After an embarrassing day of school, Lamune returns home, but on his way he sees what looks like a match girl having trouble explaining that she isn't selling matches, she's selling a video game. So he buys one and easily convinces the other people to buy one as well.\n\nThe girl mysteriously disappears after Lamune asks what kind of game it is, as the game was simply entitled \"King Squasher\". Upon returning home he immediately turned on the TV to play it, staying up until midnight until he finally beats the game.\n\nThe girl that sold him the game came out of the TV and announced her name was Milk, and that Lamune is the blood relative of the hero Lamuness, and he is destined to save the Hara-Hara World from the evil Don Harumage. And without question Lamune is dragged into their world where he then acquires Tama-Q, an advisor robot that can turn him into Lamuness, so he can use the guardian knight, King Squasher. With this he is now ready to fight Don Harumage in order to save the world."
