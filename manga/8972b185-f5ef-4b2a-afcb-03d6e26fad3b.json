   "en": "(from amazon.jp):\n\nThis collection contains seven short manga and a series of short manga spreads, mainly from two medium-length serials that Katsuhiro Otomo made between 1979 and 1980, when he was 25-26 years old.\n\nThe title work, “G.....” which depicts the battles of former German mercenaries involved in the civil war in a small African country, has never been collected, but the four chapters (approx. 80p/unfinished) are finally included in this release. The depiction of ground battles and fighter planes in this work is breathtaking, and it is a powerful work filled with the same artistic and dramatic power as later works such as “My Feelings are Already War” and “AKIRA.\n\nAlso included are all four chapters of “The Saint Comes to Town” which depicts the uproar and miracles caused by the visit to Japan of a famous jazz band from the past, and “Otomo Katsuhiro's Nutritious Fullness” a series of parodies of children's stories that appeared in the music magazine “rockin'on” on a double-page spread. \n\nwhich was serialized in the music magazine “rockin'on” as a two-page spread.\nThe other short stories included are two from “Sayonara Japan” (1981, Futabasha), one from “Hansel and Gretel” (1981, Sony Magazines), two from “Her Thoughts...” (1990, Kodansha), and two from “SOS Daitokyo Tankentai” (1996, Kodansha). \n\n(1996, Kodansha).\nThe short story “DON QUIXOTE” was changed from the original version, in which the left and right sides of the koma were switched to open on the right, to this version, in which the koma are opened on the left from the end of the volume.\n\nIn addition, all short stories that were in color when first published in the magazine have been restored.\n\n---\nOTOMO THE COMPLETE WORKS Volume 6"
