Nichijou is currently ranked in the top 50 best selling manga in Japan.\n\nHis manga are known for minimalist, absurdist humor that expresses the insanity or inanity of everyday life and human relationships. In 2020, Arawi started posting animated shorts on his YouTube channel, in which he preforms all the voice acting.\n\n\n\n"
