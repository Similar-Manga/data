   "en": "1: Mimitabu no Riyuu (A Reason For Earlobes)  \nYamaguchi is a notorious womanizer. Some men admire him; others can't stand him. Ishikawa is definitely one of the latter. Nevertheless, when Yamaguchi's latest girlfriend dumps him, Ishikawa jokingly offers to comfort him with his own body. Unfortunately for Ishikawa, Yamaguchi takes the offer seriously. And, to make matters worse, Ishikawa discovers that he can't say no!  \n  \n2: Yubisaki no Biyaku (Love Potion Fingertips)  \nIshikawa and Yamaguchi are dating, but Yamaguchi's lovey-dovey behavior makes Ishikawa sick. Hoping to put Yamaguchi in his place, Ishikawa suggests that they \"see other people.\" But things take a turn for the worse when each one catches the other with a beautiful woman.  \n  \n3: Kuchibiru no Teppen (The Top Of The Lip)   \nIshikawa usually wears an irritable scowl. So why is he laughing and smiling so happily? Is it because he likes homemade sweets… or the cute girl who made them? Consumed with jealousy, Yamaguchi's patience is pushed to the limit.  \n  \n4: Tsumuji no Mannaka (The Center Of The Hair Whorl)  \nIshikawa's nightmare is in danger of becoming reality. His boyfriend, Yamaguchi, is trying to win over his family! Fearing for his future, Ishikawa forbids Yamaguchi to visit his home, but Yamaguchi is determined to get close to the Ishikawas, one way or another. If Ishikawa won't accept him, then maybe Ishikawa's sister, Hitomi, will…  \n  \n5: Ushirosugata no Natsu no Neko (The Summer Cat Turns Its Back)  \nAfter bad news from the doctor, a man reminices about a young man he went to school with, but then young man appears and he hasn't aged…",
   "pl": "Yamaguchi jest znanym kobieciarzem. Niektórzy mężczyźni podziwiają go, inni nie mogą go znieść. Ishikawa jest zdecydowanie jednym z tych ostatnich. Niemniej jednak, kiedy Yamaguchiego rzuca nowa dziewczyna, Ishikawa żartobliwie oferuje pocieszyć go własnym ciałem. Niestety dla Ishikawa, Yamaguchi przyjmuje ofertę serio. I, co gorsza, Ishikawa odkrywa, że nie może powiedzieć nie!"
