   "en": "The year is 2061, when space travel is now possible and commercially viable, and the students of Caird High School embark on their Planet Camp.  \nBut soon after Group B5 arrived at their planetary camp site, a mysterious and unforeseen sentient light sphere warps its 9 members into outer space, stranding them 5012 light years away from their home planet.  \nWith the discovery of an old, unmanned spaceship nearby, the students must stay strong, manage their limited resources and remain united in the darkness of space, so that all of them can survive their long and likely perilous trek back home aboard the Astra.\n\n---\n- **Won the 12th Manga Taisho Award in 2019**",

Но стоило им высадится в месте назначения, появилась таинственная светящаяся сфера, и перенесла их в открытый космос, за 5012 световых лет от родной планеты. После того, как они нашли заброшенный космический корабль, у них появился шанс выжить. Собравшись с силами, и используя все имеющиеся ресурсы, они начали свой долгий полет к дому.  \n  \n- Won the 12th Manga Taisho Awards in 2019.\n  \n\n\n---\n\n**Links:**  \n- [Author's Twitter](https://twitter.com/kentashinohara_)  \n- [Anime on ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=21779)"

Starting his career as a salaryman, Shinohara decided to drop out of his white-collar job for two years while preparing for his debut as a manga artist.\n\nShinohara worked as an assistant under Hideaki Sorachi on Gintama for a short time using the alias Shintaroh Nakae (なかえ しんたろう, Nakae Shintarō), an anagram of \"Kenta Shinohara\". During his stint with Sorachi, Shinohara called him a \"teacher\" who taught him necessary skills.\n\nIn both June and September 2003, Shinohara was a finalist for the monthly JUMP 12 Outstanding Rookie Manga Award (ジャンプ十二傑新人漫画賞), though he did not win either awards.\n\nShinohara wrote two one-shots for Sket Dance in the winter and summer of 2006, submitting them to Akamaru Jump and Weekly Shōnen Jump respectively. The second one-shot was a pilot arranged in a book volume format, similar to the eventual first chapter of the main series. Serialization of Sket Dance began on 14 July 2007 in Weekly Shōnen Jump.\n\nIn the fifteenth volume of Sket Dance, released on 1 September 2010, Shinohara announced that he would be getting married.
