   "en": "Aoi who liked Shono in the track and field club and watched club activities after school every day. However, the day before the tournament, Shono did not come to the tournament, saying that she had a story with Aoi. And as the days went by, Aoi became a high school student. There she will meet Shono for the first time in three years. However, Shono has changed completely. It's been three years since I've been dating a girl named Misato, and Shono was taken care of by a relative in Hokkaido for those three years, but his father embezzled the company's money, evaporated, and a rough life. I was told that I was doing it. Can Aoi feel that she wants to like Shono because she can leave her unrequited love? ??\n\n(from mangaupdates)"
