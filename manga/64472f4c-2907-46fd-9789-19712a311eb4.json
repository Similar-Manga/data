   "en": "This manga is partly inspired by the real-life Japanese horse bandit, Hakuro Kohinata, and depicts the tumultuous life of Kensaku Ohinata, who moved to China at a young age, was kidnapped by a group of horse bandits, but rose to prominence among their ranks and eventually grew up to unite a number of them under the name of Xiao Dongyang. Kensaku's adventurous spirit and ambition, as well as his positive, brave personality, can sometimes lead to light-hearted mischief, but as he matures into a young man, he grows to experience bouts of delusion. Regarded as one of Mitsuteru Yokoyama's most realistic and human works, this manga draws inspiration from another real-life Japanese horse bandit: Date Junnosuke, thus vividly depicting the reality of Chinese horse bandits."
