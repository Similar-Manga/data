   "en": "A spin-off work starring Kamui, one of the main characters of Kamui-den.\n\nThe first 2 volumes were published in a Shounen magazine and ended with the 20th chapter in 1971. The manga changed art style and direction when it switched to a Seinen publication in 1988. The violent and sexual explicit part of the narrative was the basis for the American adaptation by Eclipse Comics in the 1980s and its unedited Viz re-release in 1999."
