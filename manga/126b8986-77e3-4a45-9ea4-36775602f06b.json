   "en": "A family of samurai boys who grew up in the mountains move to the big city of Tokyo!\nThe original boy adventure work drawn by the god of comicalization is back here!\n\n[Synopsis] Bokuden-kun,\nthe 17th generation of Tsukahara Bokuden, a master swordsman who lives deep in the mountains of Gifu, is a terrible coward and always pisses off his father. However, when he picks up the famous sword Rikimaru that was passed down to him by his ancestor, his strength and courage well up...\n\n[Commentary]\n\"Bokuden-kun\", which began serialization in Akita Shoten's \"Boken Ou\" in 1959, is a shonen action manga by Daiji Kazumine, who serialized \"Nanairo Kamen\" in \"Bokura\" in the same year. Readers were captivated by the Popeye-like main character, who is usually a weak boy who suddenly becomes stronger when he picks up a sword, the comical main character's father, and the slightly goofy villain. In the following year, it was made into a TV drama, and it is a work that has accelerated its popularity. This book version will be delivered as a [complete version] that contains all the stories of the manga serialized in \"Boken Ou\". In addition, the obi posted a new cut for the first time in 40 years and a TV drama cut by Mr. Ichimine. I would like you to enjoy the work that has many fans and can be counted as one of Daiji Izumine's representative works."
