   "en": "Several years have passed since the battle of Sekigahara, which divided the world. The world belonged to the Tokugawa.\nAt that time, there was a middle-aged ronin who lived quietly in a tenement house in the Edo castle town. The man's name is Muchabei. He was raising a boy, Bokemaru, by himself while doing a side job of attaching umbrellas.\nBokemaru was the grandson of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nMuchabei tries to revive the Toyotomi family by enlivening Bokemaru, but Bokemaru is, as the name suggests, unreliable.\nMuchabei and Bokemaru, as well as the Tokugawa shogun Iemitsu, and the irresponsible ninja Kabrezukin interweave unique characters such as \"Humanity gag historical drama manga\".\nThis work is a high-quality digitally remastered version that has been digitized from a valuable serial manuscript. In addition, the complete recording of comics unrecorded times!\n\n Note: Digital Versions Delisted as of 2020"
