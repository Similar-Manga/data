   "en": "Yamato Keisuke, a promising freestyle swimmer, and Ninomiya Ami, a talented diver, are the offsprings of two rival families owners of confectionery shops. Two generations ago, Grandfather Ninomiya came up with an idea for an owl-shaped cake, but Grandfather Yamato quickly raised to the challenge and thought of a similar cake–but in Yamato's the owl had ears. Because they're priced the same, Yamato's extra ears were crucial, and that made the business of the Ninomiya confectionery suffer. Grandfather Ninomiya then fell ill worrying about his shop. Before his death, his last words were \"I was killed by the Yamatos\", and since that moment the two families have been sworn rivals."

After graduating from Gunma Prefectural Maebashi Commercial High School in 1969, Adachi worked as an assistant for Isami Ishii. He made his manga debut in 1970 with Kieta Bakuon, based on a manga originally created by Satoru Ozawa. Kieta was published in Deluxe Shōnen Sunday (a manga magazine published by Shogakukan) .\n\nMitsuru Adachi is well known for romantic comedy and sports manga (especially baseball) such as Touch, H2, Slow Step, Miyuki and Cross Game. He has been described as a writer of \"delightful dialogue\", a genius at portraying everyday life, \"the greatest pure storyteller\", and \"a master manga artist\". He is one of the few manga artists to write for shōnen, shōjo and seinen manga magazines, and be popular in all three.\n\nMitsuru is the youngest in the family, with two older brothers and one older sister. The second brother, [Adachi Tsutomu](https://mangadex.org/author/23fc6623-0e50-411a-a80b-5a8c01b3340a/adachi-tsutomu), was once the assistant of [Akatsuka Fujio](https://mangadex.org/author/609ce7f0-4f06-4074-90c3-5bd714f09e57/fujio-akatsuka), and Mitsuru was also affected in manga because of this, and his first work was also found with the help of his brother. However, after Mitsuru became famous, his brother's work still did not improve, and finally died of illness. Therefore, Mitsuru respected his second brother Tsutomu very much, and often depicted the image of friendly brothers in his manga.\n"
