   "en": "The revolutionary work that became the source of the birth of the immortal marine sci-fi comics \"707\" and \"Blue 6\" has been made into a book for the first time!\n\n\"Shonen Typhoon\", which was serialized in the monthly manga magazine \"Shonen\" for two and a half years from the January 1962 issue, depicts the crew of the huge nuclear-powered aircraft carrier \"Typhoon\", which has a human resource training institution indispensable for the space development era. This is an ocean youth giant story depicting the friendship and adventures of Santa Yamakawa and Daisuke Kazama, the boys who were chosen as the crew\n\nThe illustrator is Satoru Ozawa, a pioneer of marine science fiction comics such as \"Submarine 707\" and \"Blue No. 6\". At the time, the author, who wanted to break his brush and live as an engineer, started this series because he wanted to draw an aircraft carrier at the end. Submarine 707” was the trigger for serialization in the same magazine.\n\nAs the author himself recalls, \"The work of fate that decided my life\", \"Shonen Typhoon\" can see the essence of masterpieces such as \"Submarine 707\", \"MM Santa\", and \"Blue No. 6\" that will be released later. , It can be said that it is an epoch-making work for Ozawa World.\n\nThis book (all 3 volumes) is a complete version that includes all episodes, all door pictures, 4 read-out stories, and a self-remake version of the \"Shonen King\" series. We would like you to fully enjoy the source of the works that will never fade in any era."
