   "en": "Citizen of the Wind Lyuba embarked on a journey of training in order to obtain the qualifications to be the magistrate of the Magic Academy. Originally, the people of the wind fulfill the duty of protecting the governor. Magic is forbidden during training, so the power is sealed with a mask. However, in order to save the female thief Femalel, who has been captured by a demon, he ends up using forbidden magic. At that time, in the country of Io, the magistrate, Bakun, who fell into the devil, demanded the independence of the Magic Academy and caused a rebellion. Female had stolen Bakun's treasure, the Hickle Ball. Duncan the hunter and Exe from the Magic Academy joined the two traveling together. In the process of fighting towards the labyrinth castle where Bakoon resides, Lyuba acquires the \"Sword of Light\". Bakun intercepts the four who have finally boarded the labyrinth castle with the \"Sword of Darkness\". When two great powers clash, a cataclysm called \"Night of Argenia\" occurs. If you read"
