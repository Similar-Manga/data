   "en": "Hayate destroyed the blood wheel party after a long battle. However, Chiguruma Shinsai, the leader of the Chiguruma Party, turns out to be Hayate's biological father...\n\nTime has flown, and now 360 years have passed. Awakened from a long sleep by an ancient voice, Hayate jumps into Shinjuku at night, but is pulled back into custody by the forces of Iga, who had kept him in custody. In his vague memories, Hayate recognizes the existence that killed his father as a \"storm.\" However, as he gets involved with Retsu and others, he remembers the past that has faded, and is upset when he faces the fact that he killed his father and his own harsh fate.\n\nOn the other hand, after learning of Hayate's resurrection, Shirakami, also known as Honegijinmaru, sends an assassin to further awaken Hayate. Hayate, who witnessed the success of Retsu and Iga Ninja, finds a ray of light in his heart. In order to get used to modern life, he goes to the high school Retsu and his friends attend. There, he encounters a school hijacking incident caused by the terrorist group Blackbird led by Nike . While feeling the shadow of the blood wheel party in the strange incarnation of Nike and others, he shows them an overwhelming difference in ability and suppresses the incident.\n\nAfter that, he is summoned by the head of the village of Iga, told the truth about his father's death and the news of the resurrection of Honebaminemaru, and is entrusted with the destruction of the Blood Car Party. Although he refuses a tough fight, Hayate senses the power of the modern Iga clan and decides to lead the Iga ninja group to fight against the blood cart party."
