   "en": "A man washed up on an unknown, isolated island has lost his memory. Giant creatures roam around, ruthlessly devouring their prey. Suddenly, the man trembles in fear and discovers an extremely high castle wall. He expected to see signs of civilization and humans, but a large number of corpses were dumped from the top of the castle wall, refusing to come. As the man secretly watched the situation on the castle wall, he began to feel a strong desire to go to the other side of the wall. What will happen on the other side of this high wall, and what will be the fate of this man? One of Hideshi Hino's masterpieces, painted in 1972. The fantastical world view that makes you feel color in monochrome gradually pulls the reader away from reality. You too will get lost in a mysterious space along with the main character. Recreate the original cover from the first edition as much as possible. Includes many other masterpieces."
