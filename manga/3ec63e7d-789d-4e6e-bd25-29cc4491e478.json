The following year, 1980, was the eve of the mangaka's talent becoming known to the world when he began to work on \"Domu\" and \"Feeling Already at War\" and other short stories, which were rising to a level of perfection as if in gestation, changed in style with each one, forming an astonishing multifaceted body of work. \n\nIn particular, the title work, \"Fire-Ball,\" is an important serial that opened the eyes of the mangaka, who until then had spun realistic human dramas, to a new genre, SF. It was a milestone for Otomo, as it depicted \"supernatural powers\" that directly led to his later works \"Domu\" and \"Akira,\" and its depiction of the spectacular completely changed the style of his previous works. \n\nThis collection includes two stories from \"Short Peace\" (1979, Kisotengaisha), four stories from \"Highway Star\" (1979, Futabasha), three stories from \"GOOD WEATHER\" (1981, Kitan-sha), and two stories including the title story from \"Her Memories...\" (1990, Kodansha). (1990/Kodansha). In addition, \"Distant Festival,\" a previously uncollected short story, is included for the first time in this long-awaited tankoban. In addition, all color pages that were previously in grayscaled  are now restored. The commentary by Otomo himself is also worth reading.\n\n---\n**Volume 5 of the Katsuhiro Otomo Complete Works**"
