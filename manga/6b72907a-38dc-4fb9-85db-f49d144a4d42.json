   "en": "Ichiko Igarashi works for a major trading company and is a top performer in the second sales section in order to fulfill her dream of becoming a professional woman. She has been in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend, who works in the same section, and she thinks she is sailing smoothly in both her personal and professional life, but then, unexpectedly, she gets her heart broken! \"I can't stand to be around a perfect guy like you...I was rejected because I'm better at my job than my boyfriend?\" \n\nStunned and burnt out, I was drunk in a park when a man who happened to be sitting next to me took me into his arms. He was gentle and kind, and he healed her, and she decided to forget about her ex-boyfriend and get on with her work. \n\nThe next day, Ichiko's sales performance is recognized and she is transferred to the Sales Section 1, the most profitable section in the company! Ichiko is delighted, but the section chief is rumored to be a very strict and devilish boss. She goes to greet him, but is surprised to meet a man in a park...?"
