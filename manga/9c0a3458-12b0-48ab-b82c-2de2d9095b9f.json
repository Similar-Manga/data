   "en": "1199 - 10 years after the death of Minamoto no Yoshitsune at Hiraizumi. Japan is now under the shogun Minamoto no Yoriie, son of Yoritomo, who had schemed against Yoshitsune. Yoriie hears of followers of Yoshitsune still lurk about, and is more than willing to get rid of those thorns in his side. However, they are more pertinent than he could imagine...for Yoshitsune's orphaned son, Hoshiwakamaru, has survived, and is planning to avenge his father with fellow pirates and conspiring officials!\n\nA tale of alternate history set at the dawn of the Kamakura period, with some fantastical elements mixed in."

Some of his most famous work as a character designer or director are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Brave Raideen\", \"Combattler V\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam\".\n\nIn 1979, he made his debut as a mangaka with \"Arion\" serialized in the newly founded magazine \"Ryu\". Following this, Yasuhiko alternated between the Anime and Manga worlds with works like \"Kiba - The Legend of White Fang\", \"Crusher Joe\", and \"Giant Gorg\", and \"Star of the Kurds\", \"C-Court\", and \"Venus Wars\".\n\nThese worlds would overlap, when his manga \"Arion\" would get adapted into an anime film in 1986 with the title \"Neo Heroic Fantasia: Arion\".

The anime film adaptation for \"Venus Wars\" came at an unfortunate point for Yasuhiko, and the film was sealed, preventing it from being made readily available on home video formats in Japan (though still made accessible overseas).
