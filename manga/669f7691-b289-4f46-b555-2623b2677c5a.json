   "en": "Childhood friends Elise and Leon have always played together and even as they grew up, they maintained that closeness, although they couldn’t deny the intimate connection that started to grow. But everything changes when Elise is chosen to become the next and ninth “bride” to the forest god. The most beautiful and charismatic girl from the village is chosen every 11 years to become the maiden at the shrine to represent the people. This honorable position comes with drawbacks, however, such as the rule that relationships with men are strictly prohibited.\n\nThe shrine chief priest Zadias is assigned to train her with the ways of being the bride. But when Leon is caught talking to Elise in secret, he is kicked out of the city and into the wilderness and left alone to die. The heartbroken Elise, leaving all her duty behind, chases after him, hoping that she catches up to him before she loses him forever. But the people from the shrine are not too far behind, trying to bring her back.\n\n(Source: MangaUpdates)"
