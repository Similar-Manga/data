   "en": "Through the creative works of the people of future generations, the famous military commander Oda Nobunaga has been toyed around with more than anyone else in history. While being repeatedly reincarnated into the worlds of these \"fictional Nobunagas\", he eventually forgets the era in which he lived as a military commander, and even his own gender, having become like smouldering cinders in the present day. Mori Ranmaru, who had been his page, begins to faintly remember how Nobunaga looked in the original world, and resolves himself to restore Nobunaga to his original state of prominence. Akechi Mitsuhide becomes a hindrance to doing so, being too strong for Nobunaga and Ranmaru each time they try to take him down. And each time Nobunaga loses, it results in the end of the world and his reincarnation into a different world?!\n\nSource: Earth Star Entertainment"
