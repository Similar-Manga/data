   "en": "The story of fictional baseball player Yasutake Kageura.  \n  \n As of 2014, the manga has over 22 Million copies in circulation.\n\n(from Wikipedia.ja):\nYasutake Kageura , also known as \"Abu-san,\" was born on December 17, 1946 and was born in Niigata City , Niigata Prefecture . His name comes from the very strong liqueur \"Absinthe\" and the on-yomi reading of his name (Yasutake → Abu). He is friends with Mitsuru Fujiwara of the Nankai, Michiyo Arito of Lotte, Koichi Tabuchi of the Hanshin Tigers, and Koji Yamamoto of Hiroshima .\n\nKageura participated in the local qualifying and finals due to a hangover in high school. He hides the smell of alcohol with garlic and hits a homerun with a flight distance of 155m or more, but vomiting during base running causes him to lose his drink and he loses. \n\nAfter that, he went to Kita-Osaka Electric after working as a member of society, Nobana Foods, but he got into trouble with the manager over the play during the game and was dismissed from disciplinary action. \n\nHe was enthusiastically invited by Nankai scout Tetsugoro Iwata to join the Nankai Hawks (later Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, Fukuoka Softbank Hawks) outside the draft in 1973 when he was drinking sake at the izakaya \"Daitora\" . \n\nHis serialization starts from there. He drinks a liquor at \"Daitora\" (later married to Sachiko Katsuragi, the signboard girl of this shop) at night, and splashes at the batter's box during the day. He was active in the Hawks as a smasher until he retired at the age of 62 in 2009. His serialization continued even after he retired from active duty, and although he was away from the ball world for a while , he returned to the team as an assistant director of the second army with the backing of Sadaharu Oh , the chairman of the Hawks team.\n\n---\n- **Won the Shogakukan Manga Award for Seinen/General Manga in 1977**"
