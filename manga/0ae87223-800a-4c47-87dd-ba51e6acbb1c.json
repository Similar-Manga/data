The guy who jumped in front of her on his skateboard looked like he had black wings…! He had jet black pupils and hair with a handsome face. And without notice he suddenly kissed her…!?  \n  \n2. Kamisama ni wa Naisho  \nMy boyfriend is the \"Angel-kun\" at school who is a pastor's son. However, I've been keeping a very big secret from him: I'm a temple girl!

I just want to find my black-hair lover, but he keeps getting in the way!  \n  \n5.
