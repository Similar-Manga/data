   "en": "Hayashi Enri was born as a feudal retainer of the Fukuoka domain at the end of the Edo period. Until then, horse farming and cattle farming had hardly been practiced, so he established a school called Kannosha, raised disciples, and spread them all over Japan. After the war, it replaced the tractor and pioneered modern farming methods. He is known as one of the three great farmers of the Meiji era, and for the first time he has made his life into a manga in an easy-to-understand manner using a huge amount of materials. When Enri was young, he traveled to Edo and Nagasaki to study, and devoted himself to martial arts by knocking on the door of Tarozaemon Egawa in Izu. Therefore, in the Meiji period, people were forced to eat cold rice. In the midst of this, Tosato, who turned to agricultural reform, showed the determination of Samurai Kuroda in his final moments, and his disciples from Fukuoka farmers risked their lives to work for Japan."
