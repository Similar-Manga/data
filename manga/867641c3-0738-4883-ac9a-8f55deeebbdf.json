   "en": "Princess Sophia, the villainess who tilted the country and staged a *coup d'état*, ended her life with a cup of poison — or so she thought. When she woke up, she was looped back to five years ago! Starting over from the age of fourteen?!\n\nIn order to avoid her execution, she decided to be a good person in her second life! Then, a serious knight protector did his best to protect her. But don't get carried away. She was the cause of his death the first time!\n\nA love story about a former princess of a leaning kingdom and a hard-nosed knight who are trying to avert all tragedies.\n\n---\nThe villainess who almost destroyed her kingdom found herself looped back to five years before her death. She is a fourteen-year old girl, loved by her father, the King, and her two brothers. Sophia remembers everything that she had done, to her maids, to her knights, to her family.\n\nBryath, her bodyguard, was loyal to her until he dies at war that she and her brother Riley started. She decides to save everyone including her, in this life. Everyone was aghast when Sophia told them she'll start studying for the kingdom. She is determined to be a real princess for people, not villainess, in this life.\n\nNow she must uncover all conspiracies to avoid the tragedy. But something is off about Bryath... he is too protective in this life?!",
