If you get anything below a 90 on every test, they punish you with torturous devices and the like. But fear not, there is one who stands up to this great injustice, in nothing but a mask and high boots. That's right, a naked fighter of Justice, Kekkou Kamen is here to punish the unfair system of the Sparta Acadamy and bring justice to those who study too much!"

Meant to be a group to help him with his works, as a consequence Harenchi Gakuen, where he derived almost no royalties from the TV series, films, or related merchandise, Dynamic Productions became a company established to manage Nagai's relations and contractual rights of his work. Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
