However, it seems that Hisase has not been able to forget his first love, Yuiko, and he wonders how he can turn this miraculous encounter into an opportunity.\nWhile Yuiko cannot give up on her ex-boyfriend, Hisase is determined to make her fall in love with him. This is a love story of a man and a woman who are at cross purposes."
