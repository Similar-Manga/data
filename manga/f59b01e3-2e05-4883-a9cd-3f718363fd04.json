   "en": "Mitsuhiko Amano is full of regrets. A 46 year old salaryman who had just been laid off, he was told that his wife wanted a divorce, something that he might have been wanting for years. So he visits a soapland, a place he hasn't been since he started dating his wife 22 years ago. While there, a fire suddenly erupts, trapping Amano and a soapland girl in the bath. In a rare moment of bravery and decisiveness, Amano attempts to lead the girl to safety, only to slip and hit his head. As his consciousness fades, he sees the back of the soapland girl making her escape… A fresh set of regret blankets him as he passes out, that his wife Sachiko and daughter Miyu will be objects of ridicule that he died in such a place…  \n  \nThen he awakens. In front of him is Ozawa Satsuki, a girl he hardly knew but secretly liked in high school. And Takahashi, Nakao-san, and Iijima-kun too. All his high school friends in their high school uniform, in their, and his, old high school… He has slipped 30 years into his past.  \n  \nHas he been given a second chance? To change his life so that the regrets that weighed him down never happen this time around?"
