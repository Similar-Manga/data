   "en": "This Manga deals with parenting, depicting the daily lives of mangaka Ohsamu Tetsuro, who strongly resembles Tezuka Osamu himself, and his family.  \n  \nThe story begins with the birth of his first son. The son is named Makoto (nicknamed Mako) and grows to be a healthy 2 year-old, basking in the love of his orderly mother and careless father. The son is followed by two daughters named Rumiko (nicknamed Rumi) and Chiiko (nicknamed Chii). This story focuses on the increasing hustle and bustle inside the Ohsamu family.\n\nAlso includes the 4-koma work \"Sorry, Mama\": The lively day-to-day family life of the young boy Yabo Onishi, his mother, and his father. Frequently, they are tempted by their desires (represented as their other selves, with devil horns and tails), and sometimes, against their better judgment, they may fall to them. But above all, they value family the most.\n\n---\n**Volume 273 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
