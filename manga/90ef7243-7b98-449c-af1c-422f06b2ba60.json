   "en": "The Cleopatra Corns Group, aka Cleopatra DC, is a powerful financial conglomerate controlling most of the United States economy, \nalmost as powerful as the US government itself. At the top of the organization is the beautiful, smart and brave Ms. Cleo, \nthe Group's young and talented Chairman, a blonde African-American who fought her way out of the slums.   \nGood thing she manages her company so well–it means she can handle the repair bill from that airplane crashing into her bedroom. \nWith stolen artifacts, corporate kidnappings, and top-secret cyborg projects gone awry, her luck only gets worse from there."

In 1985, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen for Area 88 and Futari Daka.\n\nHe was an assistant to [Shinohara Tooru](https://mangadex.org/author/3221c004-d111-4481-a46b-8248dd157bb3/shinohara-tooru) during his high school years.
