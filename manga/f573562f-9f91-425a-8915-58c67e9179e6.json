   "en": "“Falna…as long as a Ragtonia lives, the Necromancer will feed off of their life force. He took too much from you. He killed you. But I can give your life back to you, if you’ll choose to start living as a Liesian again \u0026 fight the Necromancer. When the Necromancer attacked this country, several thousand people were killed. Several thousand more had parts of their bodies stolen. They all became Ragtonia. Kill the Necromancer, release the Ragtonia and free this country from horror \u0026 destruction.”"
