   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nYoshikazu Yasuhiko, the genius behind \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\" has finally digitized his early masterpiece of adventure action set in the Middle Eastern powder keg of Kurdistan! Jiro Manabe, who has a Japanese father and a Kurdish mother, visits Turkey for the first time in ten years, guided by a letter from his mother, who has been separated from him.\n\nThe letter, however, was sent by Qasim, a Kurdish armed guerrilla known as \"Demirel\" (Iron Arm), to lure Jiro to Turkey. Giraud is caught up in a confrontation between Kurdish guerrillas and Turkish security forces in Istanbul, and flees to Kurdistan, a remote region in eastern Turkey.\n\nIn a secret tribal cave, Jiro meets a mysterious boy who shares the same name, \"Jiro\". Kurdistan is still at the mercy of international politics and in the midst of the ravages of war. However, the Kurdish people have not yielded to the oppression of the Turkish security forces, the chemical weapons of Saddam Hussein, the terrorism of the Islamic State, or the airstrikes of the Assad regime. \n\nThis is a valuable work that allows the reader to touch the source of their indomitable spirit. The Kurdish people are such a hardy and courageous people, but they are also people of misfortune. They are a people whose survival is constantly threatened, but they will surely continue to survive. We can only watch them in silence from afar."
