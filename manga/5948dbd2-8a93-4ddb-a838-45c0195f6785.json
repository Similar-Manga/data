   "en": "The main character of the series is Jigorou Ishikawa, the second of three brothers. Jigorou is a homely, fat, dirty-minded guy and frankly, a loser compared to his brothers. The elder brother Kusuo is the local 'Service Area King'--a cool and good-looking young man who gets all the girls, while the youngest brother Isao already has stalkers even though he's still young.\n\nThe story begins in the first volume with how Jigorou 'borrows' Kusuo's Cadillac so he can impress some girls by pretending that he's the 'Service Area King'. But since he's an utter twit, he ends up crashing the car. To make it short, Kusuo arrives and beats the crap out of his younger brother, who is saved only when Isao intervenes.\n\nLater at his part-time job, Jigorou then somehow gets himself stuck in a mess when he agrees to challenge Hideki 'Guillotine' Okada in a little driving duel. He rushes off to buy a car for the duel with his savings, but finds that out of 500,000 yen, he's only got 50,000 yen left in his account after having to pay for the repairs to Kusuo's car. As expected, the poor boy spazzes and Kusuo takes pity on him and takes him to a junkyard, where Jigorou ends up buying a S13 Silvia.\n\nThanks to the new car, Jigorou ends up impressing everyone at the duel with his 'super playboy technique' drifting, including one very pretty Chinatsu Honda."
