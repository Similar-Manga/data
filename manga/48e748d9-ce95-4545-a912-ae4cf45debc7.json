   "en": "A collection of short, bittersweet love stories, including several incestuous ones.  \n  \n- **1 - Until the Ice Melts and Turns to Blood**   \nThe Karaoke staff call her \"the lonely girl.\" She rents a room all night and won't go home. Why? And what can Nogami say to help her?  \n  \n- **2 - Suicide Note**  \nTwo charming girls, Michi and Rina, decide to end their lives this day. As the day ends we slowly discover why: both the horror–and the hope.  \n  \n- **3 - White**  \nIt happened once, years ago… Now it's all Minako can think about. She yearns to do it again. But how does her brother feel…?  \n  \n- **4 - Yellow**  \nShe just wants her brother to look at her–really look at her as a girl, not just a sister.  \n  \n- **5 - Blue**  \nThey were finally reunited after their parents divorced. She can't resist her feelings for him anymore. But will she lose everything for one night of bliss?  \n  \n- **6 - Prohibition**  \nA walk together. A stolen kiss. Tears.  \n  \n- **7 - Moon River**  \nA young man studies and studies while being afraid of his own problems of failing. Until he meets a girl with a specific problem of her own by the river…  \n  \n- **8 - Bitter Cakes**  \nMiho meets with her friend Natsuki, who is blind. Natsuki trusts her other senses–and herself. But Miho trusts no one–yet perhaps trusts her eyes a little too much…  \n  \n- **9 - Love Horizon**  \nA girl sees her high school crush by chance, but something is very different about him.  \n  \n- **10 - The Day It Rained**  \nA short political piece regarding a young man, and a doll.  \n  \n- **11 - No Count**  \nA young girl finds out that her first kiss was with her oniichan."
