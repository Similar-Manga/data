   "en": "In 1977, Akira Toriyama World Awawa participated with an annual competition for new mangaka, sponsored by Shueisha in Monthly Young Jump magazine. Awawa World is a short comic story that goes with superheroes and samurai in feudal Japan. Unfortunately, Awawa World was never published in full as a tankobon or even integrated into a collection or magazine of the time, but only in editions of 5 (March 1983) and No. 6 (May 1983) BIRD LAND PRESS, a newsletter of the official fan club of Akira Toriyama, Akira Toriyama called Hozonkai (鸟山明 保存 会), where this work was published in two parts. In short, Awawa World was never published commercially.This gag story set in ancient Japan attempts to mix modern situations with the older culture (such as a policeman issuing a ticket to a peasant for keeping his horse in a no-parking zone.) The artwork is pretty traditional, but the character designs are flat, heavy and rather ugly. This was an entry in the \"Monthly Young Jump Award\" contest.Some pages of the original World Awawa were exposed in exposure Ehxibition Akira Toriyama, who toured Japan in 90 years. The images shown here are part of the exhibition catalog."

     "en": "Akira Toriyama (Japanese: 鳥山 明, Hepburn: Toriyama Akira, born April 5, 1955) is a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball—his best-known work—and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.\n\nHe earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen or shōjo manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250–300 million copies worldwide, it is the third best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.\n\nBorn: April 5, 1955\nDied: March 1, 2024 (age 68 years)"
