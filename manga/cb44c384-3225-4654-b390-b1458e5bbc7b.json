   "en": "Stop and take it easy. It was serialized in \"Morning\" from 1986. Despite being in the midst of the bubble economy, it was a work that was very well received for its calm style depicting how to enjoy the life of a poor boy. A manga full of small pleasures that can be understood only by living a hard life, such as warm interactions between the humble main character and the people around him, the changing seasons, and ingenious cuisine. This time, in addition to the best selection, there are a large number of new pages, such as 6 newly drawn illustrations of Kosuke after that, an interview with the author, and a planning page that introduces the shops and foods that appear in the work."
