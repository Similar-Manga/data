   "en": "The long-awaited book version of Yokoyama's robot manga masterpiece.\n\nBased on the preserved manuscript, the long-awaited first book version for fans. A robot science fiction series that was serialized in Shonen Book from April 1962 to December 1963, during the period when Tetsujin 28-go was being serialized. Instead of a giant robot like Gigantor, Thunder Boy, a humanoid robot made to look exactly like the main character, Kenji, plays an active role. Dr. Kojo, a roboticist, completes a robot called Thunder Boy, which looks just like his son Kenji. Thunder Boy is a super robot that moves with the energy of lightning and only responds to Kenji's brain waves. The story depicts the battle between the phantom thief Menou, the gangster Gorgon, and the roboticist Duck who are targeting Thunder Boy. In addition to the 22 pages of color frontispieces, the color door from the time of serialization is also included. The appendix includes the first reprint of the science fiction novel ``The Vanishing Boy,'' which has been considered a phantom work.\n\nA rare humanoid robot appears in Mitsuteru Yokoyama's work"
