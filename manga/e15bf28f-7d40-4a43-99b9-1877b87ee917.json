   "en": "Play Ball!!\n\nThe curtain rises on the heated battle between baseball players aiming for Koshien!\nAn unconventional new member joins the prestigious Meio High School baseball club!\n\nJun Sawamura, a fastball pitcher who was active in junior high school baseball, is also known as Guts Jun. Jun thinks he has achieved the position of ace with his natural guts, but there is a big pitfall! It has flow on both sides. In addition, it was made into a TV drama at the same time as the manga series, and it gained popularity. Shiro Jimbo, the author of the original work, is also the original author of \"Sign is V'' and is a driving force behind the sports fan boom.\n\nJimbo and Obata worked together on sports works such as \"Red Fighter'' in the year before this work and \"Otoko no Mound'' in the same year, and their compatibility with sports-based manga is excellent. Also, after this work, Shunji Obata worked on a number of youth manga.\n\nFirst published work to be made into a book at the same time\n\nIncludes \"Tears of Black Belt\""
