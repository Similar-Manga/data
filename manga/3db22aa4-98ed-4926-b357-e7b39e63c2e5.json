I have to go there! “” You’ve been heading in the wrong direction this whole time. “” !!! “” What are you looking at, old man? She was just like a daughter. “” Do you want one? But I don’t think she knows that I’m her father. ······· You’re probably thinking that, right? If you think so, you’re mistaken, pops! My name is Calypso. a four-time regressor. My life was ruined when I possessed a character of a novel. I even possessed a child! The third episode of my life was an end to extermination! “The male characters who are crazy about female characters!” Yes, somehow I get back on my 22nd birthday no matter what I do. However, I only realized it on my third life, after the Dragon Duke went mad. If the dragon runs wild, the world will be distorted! But can I go back home when all of this is happening? When I came back for my fourth life, I decided to use him. Pops? Guys? he’s just a stepping stone to meet the dragon! “Wait for me, dragon-nim!” [I want to die now, but I’m going crazy with all these repeated returns.] [My family is tied up with the royal family] [Does anyone ever hear about the weak?/ Only the strongest ones are happy]"
