   "en": "One day, a little kiddo appeared before me. \n\n“Do you happen to know where the academy is? I have to go there! “\n”You’ve been heading in the wrong direction this whole time.“\n”!!!“\n”What are you looking at, old man? She was just like a daughter.“\n”Do you want one? But I don’t think she knows that I’m her father...\"\n\nYou’re probably thinking that, right? If you think so, you’re mistaken, pops! My name is Calypso. a four-time regressor.\n\nMy life was ruined when I possessed a character of a novel. I even possessed a child! The third episode of my life was an end to extermination!\n\n“The male characters who are crazy about female characters!”\n\nYes, somehow I get back on my 22nd birthday no matter what I do. However, I only realized it on my third life, after the Dragon Duke went mad. If the dragon runs wild, the world will be distorted! But can I go back home when all of this is happening?\n\nWhen I came back for my fourth life, I decided to use him. Pops? Guys? he’s just a stepping stone to meet the dragon!\n\n“Wait for me, dragon-nim!”\n\n[I want to die now, but I’m going crazy with all these repeated returns.]\n[My family is tied up with the royal family]\n[Does anyone ever hear about the weak?/ Only the strongest ones are happy]"
