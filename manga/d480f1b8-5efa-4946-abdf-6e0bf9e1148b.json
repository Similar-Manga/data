   "en": "1. My Mikage-san (Bokunchi no Mikage-san)\nIkumi just so happens to have a ninja as his housekeeper and he learned a new word at school, \"Yotogi\" (translates as \"Night Companion\"üòâ. Mikage takes it upon herself to teach him the meaning.\n\n2. My Mikage-san 2\nMikage is dragged off by a shocked Ikumi because, when questioned by the class, she stated that she doesn't wear panties to school.\n\n3. Azumi-chan Kick! (Azumi-chan Ketobasu!)\nFed up with being dominated (and beaten up) by his dojo-mate Azumi, Kenichi gets some ninja medicine from Mikage to make his childhood friend a little more docile.\n\n4. Troubled Minato-senpai\nTsuna gets some proportion-altering lotion from Mikage, but wants her kouhai Hagimura to apply it onto her rather than to apply it herself.\n\n5. Yumiko-san in the Library\nCaught rubbing herself on a desk corner in the library, Yumiko can longer approach her crush Araki. Thankfully, Mikage helps out by delivering Araki directly to Yumiko, bound and gagged for convenience.\n\n6. Emiri-ojousama's Favorite\nOnce part of a distinguished lineage, Emiri and her family are now your standard middle-class family. Kurou is the only remaining member of a ninja clan that served them, and he voices his distaste about Emiri's recent closeness with Ikumi.\n\n7. Revenger Mitsuki\nIkumi discusses his future plans with his teacher. During the discussion, the teacher is reminded of a student-become-ninja of his and how Ikumi shouldn't follow example.\n\n8. My Mikage-san 3\nHaunted by a deathly injury given to her by Mitsuki moments before starting her life with Ikumi, Mikage comes to grips with her feelings for Ikumi and pledges to stay by his side for the rest of her life.\n\n9. Mahiru Overheat (1st part in \"Renai Stampede\"üòâ\nTsuji and Mahiru haven't seen each other since winter break started (and she confessed her love for him). After not seeing eachother for so long, neither of the two can hold themselves back a moment longer.\n\n10. Akeno After (1st part in \"Renai Stampede\"üòâ\nYet again, after making a promise with her student/cousin Yukihiro, Akeno must submit to his cosplay demands, this time in traditional school sportswear (i.e. Bloomers)\n\n+ an Omake page for each maiden's story.\n\n| Namespace | Tags |\n|:-|:-\n|MALE| blindfold, bondage, glasses, schoolboy uniform\n|FEMALE| assjob, bandages, big ass, bike shorts, bloomers, bondage, dark skin, defloration, dougi, femdom, fundoshi, glasses, kimono, kunoichi, mouth mask, muscle, ponytail, scar, schoolgirl uniform, small breasts, squirting, sumata, swimsuit, tanlines, tomboy, tracksuit\n|OTHER| multi-work series, story arc, tankoubon, uncensored"
