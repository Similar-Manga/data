In addition to his very popular pilot comics, Shintani has successfully ventured into science fiction, fantasy, comedy, and hentai comics as well. In 1985, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen for Area 88 and Futari Daka.\n\nHe was an assistant to [Shinohara Tooru](https://mangadex.org/author/3221c004-d111-4481-a46b-8248dd157bb3/shinohara-tooru) during his high school years. Shintani began his career in 1972 as a shoujo artist and was nominated for the Ribon Comics Award for best new artist of that year. After working as an assistant to [Leiji Matsumoto](https://mangadex.org/author/be228b76-d5cf-46ff-9b64-38c1a012574d/matsumoto-leiji), the writer and artist of Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato, Shintani began to publish aviator titles in various comic magazines. Serialization of Area 88 began in 1979 and the title has been popular ever since.\n\nWhile working as an assistant to Matsumoto, one of Shintani's duties was to construct plastic models for drawing reference.
