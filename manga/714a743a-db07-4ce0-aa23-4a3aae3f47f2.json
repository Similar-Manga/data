   "en": "High school tough girl Aria is notorious for taking on her school's worst bullies. But punching out jerks is nothing compared to what happens when she finds herself inexplicably drawn to the demonically possessed Sakura, a guy who would as readily rip apart his own parents as seek her healing embrace. Sakura says Aria has the power to save him, but will she be able â€“ or even willing to?  \n  \nIncludes two stories:  \n  \n Road Song (Vol. 5)  \nA young girl moves into another city to fulfill her grandparent`s dying wish. As soon as she gets there she ends up being robbed. This is how all her troubles begin.   \n  \nTricky Area (Vol. 6)  \nA family moves into a new house where they get an unpleasant surprise: the house is cursed. Read and see what happens next."
