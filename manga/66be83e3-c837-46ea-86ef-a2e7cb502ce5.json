   "en": "Chloe, the daughter of parents' art supply shop \"The Bird's Nest,\" is a simple girl who is not very good at getting involved with people. This is because she was teased as a child as a \"crow living in the Bird's Nest\" because of her habitually black hair.\nOne day, while she was working at the store due to her parents' long absence, a handsome man came into the store. He was Sigurth, the artist who illustrated Chloe's favorite adventure novels.\nApparently, he was commissioned to illustrate a romance novel, which led to his inability to paint anymore. He came to the store relying on the special \"Bird's Nest\" paints. But his parents were away and there were no paints to give him...\nAt that moment, Sigurth thought that the reason he could not paint a picture of love was his lack of experience in love...so he asks Chloe to fall in love with him...!\nA pure and sweet love story between a \"simple, gloomy, art supply shop girl\" and a \"handsome painter who is a beginner in love\"!"
