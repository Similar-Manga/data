   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nRyu Todoroki has never lost a fight. However, he was outnumbered and forced into hiding. He tried to hide in a hole in a large Inari tree, but the hole was unexpectedly deep. Ryu rushed to crawl up, but something was wrong outside. \n\nIt was daytime when he fell in, but when he crawled back up, it was nighttime. Ryu, feeling a sense of discomfort, decided to go home. However, on the way there, he witnesses a police officer shoot a drunk to death...!?\n\nThe Final part of the Ryu Trilogy."

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
