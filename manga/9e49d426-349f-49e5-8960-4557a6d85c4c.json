   "en": "The Elfen Lied Special Side Story is a short manga created by Lynn Okamoto as a collectible extra within the Elfen Lied Blu-Ray release. An 8-page long story, it has not been published in any other languages nor included with releases outside of Japan, where it saw release in 2012, the tenth anniversary of the manga series. It is apparently set not in the manga continuity, but rather, in the anime's, and its timeframe seems to be around that of the OVA episode, perhaps occurring some time after that."
