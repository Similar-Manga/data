   "en": "“You look innocent… but you like it dirty, don’t you?” “My idol would never do this sort of thing!!” Issa is a huge fan of Nero, a masked idol whose face is kept secret from the public. One day, at a members-only nightclub he was drawn into a V.I.P. room by a guy who seemed like a player. Issa tried to resist, but the moment he heard a whisper in his ear, his mind was blown— the voice was just like Nero’s. Even though this guy isn’t at all like Nero, the voice that he loves made him irresistible…“If it’s not Nero, then you don’t care?” Will a romance really start between this mysterious man who has the voice of an idol and an idol obsessed college student after teasing his ears!?\""
