   "en": "Naples, 2001. Giorno Giovanna is a small-time crook with one big dream—to become a \"Gang-Star.\" No ordinary thief, Giorno has a connection to the remarkable Joestar bloodline, and possesses a Stand named Gold Experience. His dream starts to become reality when he meets Bruno Bucciarati, a mobster from the gang Passione and a fellow Stand user himself. Realizing that they share similar ideals, and both disagree with the gang's harmful affairs, Giorno reveals his goal to Bruno: with Bruno's help, he will reform Passione by overthrowing the boss.  \n  \nAs Giorno becomes a member of Passione, and is inducted into Bruno's squad, he discovers that it is no simple gang; its numbers are teeming with Stand users. Now confronted by other squads of differing loyalties and unpredictable caliber, their goal to change the gang from the inside out will be a tough one. Taking on these adversaries, Giorno attempts to rise through the ranks and inch closer to the boss, a man who is shrouded in mystery.",
   "it": "Napoli, 2001. Giorno Giovana è un piccolo criminale con il grande sogno di diventare una \"Gang-Star\". Giorno ha una connessione con la linea sanguigna Joestar, e possiede lo stand \"Gold Experience\". Il suo sogno inizia a diventare realtà quando incontra Bruno Bucciarati, un partecipante della gang \"Passione\" e un portatore di stand. Giunti alla conclusione che tutti e due hanno idee simili, e che unanimamente non concordano sugli affari della gang, Giorno rivela il suo obiettivo: con l'aiuto di Bruno, riformerà Passione spodestando il capo della gang.\n\nGiorno, una volta diventato membro di Passione ed entrato nella squadra di Bucciarati, scopre che non è una semplice gang, è piena di portatori di stand. Una volta confrontatesi con le altre squadre, sleali e imprevedibili, scoprono che il loro obiettivo di cambiare la gang dall'interno non sarà facile da raggiungere. Parlando a proposito di questi avversari, Gioeno tenta di ralire tra i ranghi per avvicinarsi al boss, un uomo circondato dal mistero."

He is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1987 and has sold over 100 million copies as of 2016 in Japan alone.\n\nAraki participated in the Junior Baseball Team in primary school and Kendo Club in middle school. He has a pair of twin younger sisters. Because he was often bullied by his sister, he would hide away to read manga. He liked manga when he was a child, so he wants to be a manga artist. His favorite works are Star of the Giants by Kajiwara Ikki , and Babel II by Yokoyama. Araki had the experience of shaking hands with Tezuka Osamu.\n\nHe likes western pop music, horror movies and Italy very much. We can see a lot of the above elements in his representative work JOJO.His painting style was influenced by Renaissance paintings, especially Michelangelo.\n\nHe gets up at 10 a.m. every day, draws a Name on Sunday, finishes the draft from Monday to Thursday, rests on Friday and Saturday, and doesn't stay up late. This work and rest lasted more than ten years . The work and rest of this law is influenced by the manga artist [Akimoto Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/1cd79d33-68b3-4879-b67a-834055ef99eb/akimoto-osamu). Although he is over 50, his face does not show his old state. He is even joked by other manga artists and fans as \"the younger he lives\", \"Immortality\", \"using corrugation or stone ghost face\", \"in fact, he is also a Stand, and his ability is that he will not grow old\"."
