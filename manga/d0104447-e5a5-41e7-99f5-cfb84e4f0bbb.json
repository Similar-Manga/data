   "en": "Sarumaru Saruya makes his first appearance in 20 years, moves his stage of activity to America, and begins training as a martial artist. The wild child genius remains unchanged, but as an adult monkey has a calm judgment and has a conviction and aesthetics for golf. Sal, who started his life in the United States as a caddy, continues his challenge."

     "en": "藤子不二雄Ⓐ\nFujiko Fujio Ⓐ\n==\nFujiko Fujio (藤子 不二雄) was a pen name of a manga writing duo formed by two Japanese manga artists. Their real names are Hiroshi Fujimoto (藤本 弘, Fujimoto Hiroshi, 1933–1996) and Motoo Abiko (安孫子 素雄, Abiko Motoo, 1934-2022). They formed their partnership in 1951, and used the Fujiko Fujio name from 1954 until dissolution of the partnership in 1987.\n\nFrom the outset they adopted a collaborative style where both worked simultaneously on the story and artwork, but as they diverged creatively they started releasing individual works under different names, Abiko as Fujiko Fujio Ⓐ (藤子不二雄Ⓐ, Fujiko Fujio Ē, credited as Fujiko A. Fujio outside Japan), and Fujimoto as [Fujiko F. Fujio](https://mangadex.org/author/42d595b6-d361-4f55-a04d-2010950d6d66/fujiko-f-fujio) (藤子・F・不二雄, Fujiko Efu Fujio). Throughout their career they won many individual and collaborative awards, and are best known for creating the popular and long-running series Doraemon, the main character of which is officially recognized as a cultural icon of modern Japan. Some influences of most of their projects are the works of acclaimed manga artist [Osamu Tezuka](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83) and many US cartoons and comic books—including the works of Hanna-Barbera."
