   "en": "From the pen of Moyoco Anno comes a stunning tale of self-image and self-loathing. *In Clothes Called Fat* details the lives of young women earnestly revealing the struggles women may have with their bodies and sexuality.\n\nNoko appears to be living a great life, she’s got a good job and a loving boyfriend, but beneath a thin veneer is a young woman who is struggling with her self-image and self-confidence as she fights to keep her weight down. To Noko, being 5 pounds overweight means being miles away from happiness in her love life and in her work-place. [Kodansha]"
