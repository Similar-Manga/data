   "en": "Tamao Tamatama, an elementary school student who has been living in heaven since he died in a traffic accident, wants to see his family so much that he asks the government office in heaven to return to earth . Mr. Zou , who works at a government office , listens to his request out of gratitude for being kind to Tama-husband while he was alive, but unfortunately the only body in heaven is that of a puppy . Tamao returns to the ground in the body of a dog, assuming that he can do anything as long as he can return to the ground. After many twists and turns, Tama-husband is welcomed by his family and friends as the original Tama-husband, even though he is in the form of a dog."
