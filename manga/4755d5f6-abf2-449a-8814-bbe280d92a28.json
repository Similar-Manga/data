   "en": "1-2) Howl at the Moon  \nMiki is the bodyguard of the super-model, Ran. He's also the only person who knows that the golden-eyed Ran is in fact a werewolf. Not only does Ran have an animalistic sex-drive, he's also inhumanly strong. “Then, why does he need me as his bodyguard?” Miki wondered… And then, Ran was stabbed by a fan while protecting Miki…  \n  \n3) Intoxicated by the Moon  \nLuke, the owner of the modeling agency where Ran works, is also a werewolf. Madoka, his assistant/secretary is always walking in on Luke seducing women in his office… but when the full moon appears, Luke is always at Madoka's house… why!? The appearance of a young new model complicates things even further…  \n  \n4) LOST  \nEvery night, Ray relives the nightmare of shooting his detective partner Steve. Unable to sleep at night, he constantly needs sleeping pills to survive. His new partner, Brad, is tortured watching Ray growing more gaunt every day. When undercover FBI agents start showing up dead, Ray's nightmares might just hold the answer to finding the culprit.  \n  \n5) Secret  \nAlan is your typical playboy - money, women and more money. When he meets an inexperienced Japanese transfer student, Masaki, in the university cafe, he decides to try it with guys too. Masaki soon realizes that he is only a toy to Alan, and returns to Japan. Years later, Alan runs into Masaki again… but Masaki is engaged!? Blackmail is in order…  \n  \n6-8) Start with a Kiss + 2 page extras (Kisu Series)  \nSuper popular high school student Nishimura Jun has a beautiful face, a great body and women lining up to have sex with him! So why is Jun still a virgin? The romantic Jun wants nothing more that a sweet and pure love. Hiding his virginity is becoming tiring, especially since kouhai Machida seems to be onto his ruse…  \n  \nAfterword",
   "pl": "Ch6-7 Kiss Series: Nishimura jest przystojny, inteligentny, popularny. I jest chodzącą legendą! Już w klasie drugiej gimnazjum, miał na koncie przeszło tysiąc zaliczonych dziewczyn, a teraz, będąc w liceum, obiera sobie za cel dobić do dwóch tysięcy. I pewnie wszystko poszłoby jak po maśle, biorąc pod uwagę fakt, iż chętnych jest całkiem sporo, gdyby nie pewien przystojny i niezwykle wnerwiający kouhai."
