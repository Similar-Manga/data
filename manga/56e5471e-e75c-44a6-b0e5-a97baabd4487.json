   "en": "Nogawa is called over to a meetup with her group of high school friends for the first time in years. However, one face among them brings about great ire within Nogawa - a certain Sawamoto, the first of their friend group to get married. During the course of their meetup, Nogawa reflects on what about Sawamoto sets her off...\n\nA collection of one-shots chiefly for josei magazines by Minori Kimura. Frequent themes and elements include office workers, one's prospects for love and marriage, psychology over time, and interpersonal relationships. In addition to the title story, also includes:\n- **Miss Ruiko's Glasses** (ルイ子さんのメガネ, Ruiko-san no Megane) - Ruiko is a young office lady who has been having some problems with her vision as of late. When she goes to get some glasses for herself, however, she stumbles upon a very peculiar glasses shop - and the glasses she gets there will give her a new perspective on things... \n- **The Fig Tree** (無花果の木, Ichijiku no Ki) - A story reflecting upon mother-daughter relationships intertwined with the Second World War, focusing on the women in the Takahashi family - a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter.\n- **Winter Journey** (冬の旅, Fuyu no Tabi) - Nakahara has set out to settle things with Kondo, a cameraman at her workplace, once and for all. Kondo and Nakahara were part of the same friend circle back in college, but since they were a few years apart, they had not met in some time after Nakahara graduated. They got along well once Kondo started working for the same publication she did, but...\n- **My Private Dream, The Night I Met Joni Mitchell** (ジョニ・ミッチェルに会った夜の私的な夢, Joni Mitchell ni Atta Yoru no Shiteki na Yume) - Minori Kimura (as *Uneri* Kimura) stars in this one-shot about her sheer admiration for the Canadian singer-songwriter. Kimura has been a long time fan of hers, but as time had gone on, Kimura was set on moving on from being such an obsessive fan. Mitchell's appearance in Japan puts that to the test, however."
