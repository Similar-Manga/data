Other hobbies immerse him in the world of manga, anime and movies.\n\nHis first readings - especially mystery - induce him to write his first novel at the age of 16, fleeing what he himself describes as \"the most depressing era of his life\", while studying and graduating simultaneously between 1994 and 1999 from the Kurume National College tries a fantasy sekai to appear for the Fujimi Prize for Novel that doesn't work.

Also, the early works were largely divided into horror novels and sad stories, which is why they were labeled Kuro Otsuichi and Shiro Otsuichi, respectively. Under the name Otsuichi, he mainly writes novels in Shueisha, Kadokawa Shoten (currently KADOKAWA), and Gentosha.\n\nInvited by his editor to audition tests of the film Innocent (2004), by director Oshii Mamoru, he meets his daughter, Oshii Tomoe, whom he married in 2006.\n\nLike Yamashiro Asako (2005) he publishes in Media Factory's ghost story magazine Yu.

Furthermore, in 2010 he also participates in the project of a series called Makai Detective Meiousei O, in which eight writers hide their names each and write a book under the name of Echizen Mataro.\n\nUnder his real name Adachi Hirotaka produces an independent film. In 2004, he was selected for the 5th Takarazuka Film Festival and Video Contest by Gōsuto wa shōsetsuka ga suki and does four more works about 2015. In 2016, Otsuichi, Nakata Eiichi, Yamashiro Asako and Echizen Mataro publish a collection of short stories - commented by Adachi Hirotaka -, called Kill Mary Sue, thus gathering all his aliases. He also revealed that he contributed a film essay under the name Yuushi Pillow, a then-unknown alias. In May 2016 issue of the Da Vinci, he also does a talk project in the top three aliases under the title A Miraculous Talk Was Made.\n\nHis style has inspired authors such as Tomoi Hitsuji, recipient of the Kono misuterī ga sugoi! 2012 to Excellence, confessing a fan of Otsuichi. Close personal friends authors Sadakane Shinji and Matsubara Makoto after taking a trip to Turkey with the author, co-write Toruko or ryokō shi.\n\nIn 2010 became father for his first child.\n\nReal name is ADACHI Hirotaka (安達 寛高).\n\nMarried to OSHII Tomoe, daughter of OSHII Mamoru.\n\nFriends with SADAKANE Shinji \u0026 MATSUBARA Makoto."
