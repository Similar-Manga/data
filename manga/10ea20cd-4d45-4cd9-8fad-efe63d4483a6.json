At the age of seven, his family moves into an apartment complex and becomes neighbors with Saguru Matsunae. Saguru soon becomes Shinobu's 'onii-san' that he goes to for advice throughout the years. Shinobu, now seventeen, is clueless about anything involving relationships or his own body and Saguru offers to teach him…  \n  \n2) Sawaki's Case  \nHideya Katsumata and Makoto Sawaki have been friends since entering high school, but Makoto has been hiding his true feelings towards his best friend for all that time. He believes his feelings will forever go unrequited as there's no way Hideya will ever fall in love with another man. When Makoto stumbles across Shinobu and Saguru (from the previous story) kissing, he starts to believe otherwise.  \n  \n3) Love Snatcher  \nAfter getting fired from his job half Japanese Tanaka Tatsuaki drunkenly prays to the moon to take him away, and it does! He's been summoned to a land of shape-shifters to be the bride of Tigure, lord of the tigers. And he's expected to give birth?  \n  \n4) Love and Reticence (Ai to Chinmoku)  \nNearly silent ghost writer Kisa has fallen in love with a small out of the way diner and the delicious food there. But handsome owner-san wants more from Kisa than his patronage.  \n  \n5) Drowning in Love (Oboreru Kankei)  \nYoshino Keiichi's life has gotten a lot more interesting since single father Kayumi Takamasa and his two young children moved in next door. Keiichi's become a mother to the youngsters, but his relationship with their father is much more complex…"
