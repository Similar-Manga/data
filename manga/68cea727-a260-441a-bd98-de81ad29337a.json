   "en": "Apollo´s Song follows the tragic journey of Shogo, a young man whose abusive childhood has instilled in him a loathing for love so profound he finds himself compelled to acts of violence when he is witness to any act of intimacy or affection whether by human or beast. His hate is such that the gods intervene, cursing Shogo to experience love throughout the ages ultimately to have it ripped from his heart every time. From the Nazi atrocities of World War II to a dystopian future of human cloning, Shogo loses his heart, in so doing, healing the psychic scars of his childhood hatred.\n\nChapter 6.\nA Tezuka One-Shot that was included in the Complete Works release of Apollo's Song but not included in either English release of Apollo's Song. It tells the story of two brothers, one a cop and the other an aspiring songwriter, who find themselves mixed up in the student protests of the late 1960's in Japan that are being led by a Christ-like folk singer.\n\n[Official English](https://kodansha.us/series/apollos-song/)\n\n---\n**Volumes 35-37 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
