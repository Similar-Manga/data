   "en": "Yuki is so ashamed of her figure that she refuses to go swimming, either at school or on the beach. She believes her ribs look strange, and hears that she can have plastic surgery to alter the appearance of her ribcage. Yuki goes to a nearby clinic that performs the procedure, but is told that she must pass a mental health assessment before she can have the surgery."

Ito's work has developed a substantial cult following, with some deeming him a significant figure in recent horror iconography.\n\nIn 2006, Junji married Ayako Ishiguro (石黒亜矢子), a picture book artist. As of 2013, they have two children."
