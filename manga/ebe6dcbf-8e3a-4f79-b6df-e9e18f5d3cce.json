   "en": "Heian-era Kyoto. Rumours swirl of the beautiful Kaguya-hime, who sets her suitors impossible tasks to complete but is a favourite of the young Emperor. The Emperor's bodyguards, the Takiguchi, have been decimated by a massacre known as \"The Night of the Bloodstained Moon\", of which there was only one survivor; the mysterious Tsukuyomi, who intervenes in a fight between the Takiguchi and the Hokumen, the forces of the ex-emperor Chiten-no-Kimi.  Tsukuyomi is the only known survivor of the Night of the Bloodstained Moon, and searches for vengeance for their brother's murder.  Yet Tsukuyomi is not what they seem in many ways - and when they meet Kaguya-hime, it becomes clear that there is far more than meets the eye to the intrigues of the Imperial Court."
