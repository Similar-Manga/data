   "en": "This work was serialized for one year from 1981 (Showa 56) in a manga magazine for children called \"Monthly 100 Ten Comic\" by Futabasha.\n\nAs a manga artist, there have been good times and bad times... This \"Mechanko Usata\" was the work that saved me when I was in a pinch. Even though he made his debut as a sports manga, he didn't quite fit in with the trends of the time... When he was halfway down, he said, \"If you're going to quit being a manga artist anyway, let's make the character (Usata) you've been creating since you were a student go wild.\" !”, and it became the first book for me (laughs).\n\nIn modern times, there may be inappropriate expressions in the content, but there is one \"Showa era children's gag manga\"...\n\nPlease take a look at it with tolerance ♪"
