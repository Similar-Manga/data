   "en": "Consumer finance, lending is also hell. Customers who are full of lies, customers who get upset, customers who easily go bankrupt. In times like these, it's hard to lend. Makoto Takagi (35 years old) was appointed as the branch manager of the Sanbonbashi Ekimae branch of a medium-sized consumer finance company, Happy Support, which is second only to major players in the industry. Takagi, a former elite banker, became a branch manager six months after joining the company. His boss imposes strict quotas on him and threatens him with immediate demotion if he fails to meet them. When he gets demoted, his annual income is cut in half. Takagi cannot afford to be demoted. He needs money to protect his beloved family, so today he lends money and collects money."
