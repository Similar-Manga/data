   "en": "Eiji Sparks, an elementary school student, has been transferred to an elementary school deep in the mountains due to his father's job. There was a legend that said, ``You should not climb Mt. Tenmayama.'' Eiji's curiosity is stimulated and he climbs Mt. Tenma with his classmate, Gen Hiraga, a young pony.\n\nThe spaceship Pandora was hidden inside . A spaceship from the Angel planet that has scientific capabilities superior to Earth's. Eiji and his friends are surprised to be completely naked in an instant , but an angel -like alien appears in front of them.\n\nAccording to the Angel aliens, once upon a time ( in the primitive era ), Pandora visited the solar system in order to extinguish the evil spirits of the Demos aliens with the sun. However, Princess Aurora, who was too kind, was unable to complete her mission and released the spirit of the Demos alien onto Earth (as a result, the primitive man who had only a conscience was imbued with an evil heart, and the history of humanity became a history of battles. ). As punishment , Princess Aurora falls into an eternal sleep, and is forced to have painful nightmares every time the villain commits a crime.\n\nAfter hearing about the angel alien, Eiji and his friends decide to save Princess Aurora from suffering. Eiji combines with the superweapon Baloo to become the telegrapher Balvar and fight against evil."

Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
