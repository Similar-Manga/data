   "en": "Set in America during the pioneering era, \"Outlaw Man\" is pursued by the Pinkertons after he is awarded with a prize. Despite the man escaping without leaving any footprints, the detective agency manages to find a small trace of his escape and persistently chases after him. The man's beloved horse, Cameron, is eventually shot and killed by the detectives, leaving him in a desperate crisis.\n\n(Addendum from mangapedia):\n \nThis is Hirohiko Araki's second debut short work, published in 1982 when he was still under the name \"Toshiyuki Araki\". It is a wild west manga following his first work \"Poker Under Arms\". The original genko (manuscript) of this work was lost, and for a long time it existed as a \"phantom work\" that had not been collected into tankobon. 2004 saw the digital reprinting of this work from the magazine in which it appeared in and is part of \"Gorgeous Irene\"."

He is best known for his long-running series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which was first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1987 and has sold over 100 million copies as of 2016 in Japan alone.\n\nAraki participated in the Junior Baseball Team in primary school and Kendo Club in middle school. He has a pair of twin younger sisters. Because he was often bullied by his sister, he would hide away to read manga. He liked manga when he was a child, so he wants to be a manga artist. His favorite works are Star of the Giants by Kajiwara Ikki , and Babel II by Yokoyama. Araki had the experience of shaking hands with Tezuka Osamu.\n\nHe likes western pop music, horror movies and Italy very much. We can see a lot of the above elements in his representative work JOJO.His painting style was influenced by Renaissance paintings, especially Michelangelo.\n\nHe gets up at 10 a.m. every day, draws a Name on Sunday, finishes the draft from Monday to Thursday, rests on Friday and Saturday, and doesn't stay up late. This work and rest lasted more than ten years . The work and rest of this law is influenced by the manga artist [Akimoto Osamu](https://mangadex.org/author/1cd79d33-68b3-4879-b67a-834055ef99eb/akimoto-osamu). Although he is over 50, his face does not show his old state. He is even joked by other manga artists and fans as \"the younger he lives\", \"Immortality\", \"using corrugation or stone ghost face\", \"in fact, he is also a Stand, and his ability is that he will not grow old\"."
