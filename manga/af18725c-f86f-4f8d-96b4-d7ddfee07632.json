   "en": "1-3 \u0026 7) The Scent of Temptation  \nShina works part-time at a café as well as a flower shop. Most days a Kanae, a salaryman and the brother of the flower shop owner, comes to have his coffee at the shop. One day a man is with him, and Shina realizes from watching their interaction that Kanae must be gay, which comes as quite a shock.  \n  \n4) When I Grow Up  \nWhen Tokiwa-san met Hiroto, he took to him because he looked so much like his dead lover. They become friends, but is that all Hiroto is to him, a substitute? And what role does Satoru, Hiroto's \"friend with benefits,\" play in all of this?  \n  \n5-6) The Fields in Which We Live  \nTakamori took in Nagisa when he was hurt, but that wasn't the end of Nagisa's troubles. His boyfriend abuses him, and Takamori just found a gay porn video featuring Nagisa. Takamori isn't gay, but he worries about Nagisa and can't get him out of his head."
