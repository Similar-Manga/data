   "en": "“I’ll make you into a beautiful butterfly. I won’t let you get away from me.” Everywhere he touched felt so good so she couldn’t resist him...! Yuri (age 20) is a university student who lives with her grandmother. Upon reuniting with friends at their Coming of Age Ceremony, Yuri is overwhelmed by how gorgeous they look and makes the decision that she herself must change. It is later that day when she is sitting strumming an old shamisen in her grandmother’s room that a kimono wearing man bursts through one of the sliding paper doors to say “You suck!” The man tells her his name is Asuka and says to her “Oh, I know every woman in Edo. However... Yuri, you are something special.” He then begins kissing her passionately. Yuri finds herself unable to resist Asuka’s charm and can do nothing but allow herself to be manipulated by his persistant tongue... “That enraptured face of yours, it really turns me on.” His fiery hot fingertips lasciviously begin to rub her nipples and... Just who is Asuka really!? And what will become of this love which crosses time..."
