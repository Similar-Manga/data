She has come back to the Western-style house on the edge of the fishing village to wait for her father, a painter, who has gone to France. She is a tomboy and hates to lose, so the boys' bullying is no problem for her. Together with kind teacher Makimura, she begins to search for her father's whereabouts, but ......? This is the story of Yuka, a young girl who is undaunted by any misfortune, and who nobly and patiently continues to wait for her father!"
