   "en": "Medieval Arabia. Sinbad, a boy with sanpaku eyes , was troubled by his appearance, which was different from the people around him, and wanted to know the secret of his birth. One day, by chance, he gets to know the female fortune teller, Lulu, and has her look into her past with the jewel she has, the \"Eyes of Marute,\" which allows him to see through all times. At the same time, Lulu is kidnapped by the great magician Raas, who wanted the \"Eyes of Marute\" in order to break the seal on the sacred wall that protects the jewel \"Tears of Harute\" that can see through all space.\n\nIn order to regain Lulu and the Eye of Marut, and to confirm his birthplace with his own eyes, Sinbad sets out on a journey with the fortune teller Jaris, who has a good understanding of him."
