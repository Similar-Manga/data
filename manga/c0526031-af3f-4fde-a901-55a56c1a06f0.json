   "en": "Deep in the mountains of Okuchichibu, Saitama Prefecture, there is a school that has been left behind by its surroundings and is now in ruins. It is a private Okuchichibu High School. A teacher was called to the school, which had no funding, enrollment was declining, and had been repeatedly advised by the prefecture to close. Ryuji Kurosawa, former Meio High School baseball coach. He was specially called in to take this high school, which was on the verge of closure, to Koshien. However, the baseball club in question was disbanded two years ago. In other words, we have to start by creating a baseball club. Kurosawa was about to give up on this almost impossible challenge when a first-year student caught his eye. He was Yamato Nanjo, a baseball prodigy with a hidden talent!"
