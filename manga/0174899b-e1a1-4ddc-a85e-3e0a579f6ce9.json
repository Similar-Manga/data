This work often depicts the role of police, self-defense, and other forces when fighting against monsters and mysterious organizations.

Although the two have in common that the main character is a newspaper reporter, it can be said to be a symmetrical work to \"The Condor King''. Take a look at Takeuchi's world, which is a little different from detective action works!"
