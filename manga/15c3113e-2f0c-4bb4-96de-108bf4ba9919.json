   "en": "The man who hates evil and sides with the righteous is back! Theadventure story of the third masked hero alongside \"Moonlight Mask'' and \"Seven Colored Mask'' has been made into a book for the first time!!The curtain rises on the battle for the four secret maps! \nWho will have the last laugh?\n\n[Synopsis]\nGoro Narumi, a famous detective, takes on the Crimson Lizard Gang, who are working behind the scenes, aiming for the four secret maps that mark the location of the secret treasures of the Kabayan Kingdom. Furthermore, a villain who started a rebellion in the Kabayan Kingdom also appears, leading to a three-way battle! How will the ally of justice, the Messenger of Allah, who appears like the wind, act!?\n\n[Commentary]\n\"The Messenger of Allah'' began airing on TV in 1960 as a follow-up to \"Nanairo Kamen,'' the first Toei Kamen Hero work. The leading role of Goro Narumi, the Messenger of Allah, was played by Shinichi Chiba, just as he played the role of Kotaro Ran, the second Nanairo Kamen in \"Nanairo Kamen,'' and he attracted viewers. Also, in the same year, it was adapted into a comic by Tatsuo Yoshida in Akita Shoten's \"The King of Adventures,'' which perfectly depicts the righteous adult idealized by the original author, Yasunori Kawauchi. This book is the first time that the comic version has been made into a book.\nI want you to feel the essence of this orthodox hero work that follows the flow from \"Moonlight Mask\"!"
