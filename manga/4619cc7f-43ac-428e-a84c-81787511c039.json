   "en": "Shigeta, a young woman of 24, spends her days working at Tanaka Books and fretting over her love-life or, more accurately, the lack thereof. The thing is, though, the biggest obstacle between Shigeta and a satisfying relationship seems to be Shigeta herself. When it comes to men, the poor girl has exceedingly poor judgment, exacerbated by her even poorer self-esteem, having sex with most the men who cross her path."
