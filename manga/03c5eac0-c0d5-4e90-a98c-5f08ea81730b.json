With two serializations - one in a magazine for middle schoolers, and one in a magazine for adults - join 00Goro (or Ippei Shirakawa in the adult magazine serialization) and his fellow members as they deal with various plots that threaten the peace. \n\nThe serialization for middle schoolers has a lighter tone, is clean, and more gags, whereas its adult serialization is more melancholic and can be suggestive at times.\n\nAlso includes the following otona (adult) manga:\n- **5SS**: Read as 'Five Six Seven', this serial covers the sometimes naughty, sometimes deadly, sometimes humorous exploits of three members of a time patrol, led by 5.\n- **Pink Tiger**: A biologist finds himself interested in a certain 'specimen' at the bar he frequents - but this specimen proves to be a little too much for him.\n- **Super Express Hatoko-Chan**: An episodic work about Hatoko, a newspaper reporter who often finds herself in whimsical and naughty situations as she strives to obtain manuscripts and gather reports."

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga. He was also one of the most productive creators, producing over 120,000 pages of artwork in thirty years. It's rumored that he drew over 500 pages in one month!"
