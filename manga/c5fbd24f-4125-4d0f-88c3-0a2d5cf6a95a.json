   "en": "There was a fire. Kousei lost his mother, his father and his precious little sister, Sanae. One month later he woke up to find himself in a hospital and was moved to pediatrics where he could share a room with other boys his age.  \n  \nProfessor Kimishiro is loved and respected by his students, but disliked by faculty and administration. He's pushed from his classroom by university politics and takes a team to the jungles of the Amazon in search of new medicines and perhaps a chance to gain back his reputation amongst those with influence back home. Instead of cures, his team stumbles upon a lost temple in the jungle, a place the village guides claim to be 'The House of the God of the Black Death'. What are the temple's secrets, and can any man, let alone a mere boy, survive the plague of an angry God?"
