   "en": "\"Future Person Ken'' has always been at the top of the rankings of \"works I have not read yet'' and \"works I would like to read someday'' created by many Jiro Kuwata (Jiro Kuwata) fans. . This is an excellent science fiction manga that was serialized in the standard school year magazines of the time, \"Second Years of Junior High School'' and \"Single Years of Junior High Schools,'' for a long period from September 1968 to July 1969.\n\nWith the cooperation of Obunsha, this fantastic Kuwata manga has been made into a book for the first time in 37 years! The main story and cover art are faithfully reproduced as they were when they were serialized, without any re-editing. In addition, \"Ore wa Ishimatsu'' and \"Karada no Naka no Himu'', which were serialized in Obunsha's \"Junior Third Age'', are included at the same time. Fans who had given up thinking they would never have the chance to get their hands on it again, and people who saw it in real time as readers during their \"second and third year middle school years.\" Thank you for waiting!! Please enjoy the ultimate thrill. Complete collection of 3 works (more than 500 pages!) that have never been published in book form, including the text and cover art. I tried to exploit the blind spots of Jiro Kuwata fans."
