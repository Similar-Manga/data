   "en": "A stiff yellow flower blooms in the corner of the garden. Keiko, who was still a child, picked her mother's flowers without hearing her mother's accusations. When her father, a novelist, saw his daughter like that, he remembered his own childhood. The memory of picking flowers seems like yesterday, yet it's strange to see the young girl whose lives we shared repeat the same thing... As time passes, Keiko, who has grown older, is about to get married. Keiko has seen her mother support her father, who couldn't write a novel and drank alcohol all the time. However, recently there have been some subtle changes between the two... A collection of short stories by Hiroshi Asuna, a talented artist who depicts the human heart with a delicate touch full of lyricism."
