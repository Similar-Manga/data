   "en": "Long, long ago, a woman who had coupled with a strange beast gave birth to a Saishi, a half-human half-beast creature, whose body was filled with venom. These brutal creatures were used in battle during times of unrest, but during times of peace, they were shunned and hated. Indeed, they were cursed.  \n  \nA Ronin samurai called Gen Tsukinosuke is one of the few surviving Saishis and the owner of a magnificent sword, the \"Fangs of God.\" He travels in search of his estranged sister and sleeps with women who yearn for death, killing them with his deadly poison. The story takes place in the war-torn days at the end of the Edo period. With a destiny to be a Kaishi, Tsukinosuke is also being swallowed up by the harsh flow of history.",
   "pt-br": "Há muito, muito tempo atrás, uma mulher, que havia se relacionado com um estranho animal, deu à luz a um Saishi, uma criatura meio-humana meio-besta, cujo corpo estava repleto de veneno. Essas criaturas perigosas foram usadas em batalhas nos tempos conturbados, mas em tempos de paz, foram evitadas e odiadas. Foram, de fato, amaldiçoados.\n\nUm samurai Ronin, chamado Gen Tsukinosuke, é um dos poucos Saishi's sobreviventes e o portador de uma incrível espada, chamada de \"Presas de Deus\". Ele viaja a procura de sua irmã e dorme com mulheres que anseiam pela morte, matando-as com seu veneno mortal. A história se passa nos dias de guerra no final do período Edo. Com o destino de ser um Kaishi, Tsukinosuke também está sendo engolido pelo rigoroso fluxo do tempo."
