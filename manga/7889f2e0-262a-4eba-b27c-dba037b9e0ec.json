   "en": "Rin Anjo, 25 years old. Occupation: Housekeeper. She has just been fired from her job as a housekeeper. Still, she is too much of a caring person to change her nature, and today, she takes care of her drunken friend and saves a man who was crouching on the side of the road in a heavy rainstorm. The next day, he is told that his former employer has offered him an exclusive contract with good terms and conditions, and that he will be fired. Fearfully, she heads for a large mansion where there is already a veteran housekeeper. What awaits him there is the man who collapsed that rainy night, Todo. The man who had fallen on that rainy night was waiting for her. \"Rin Anjo is yours from today,\" she told him, puzzled by his sudden words. --He then begins to talk volubly about how he wants to help Rin. Rin is stunned, but Todo's love and outbursts only accelerate...?"
