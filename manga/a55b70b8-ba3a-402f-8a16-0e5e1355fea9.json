   "en": "Yuzuki, a new editor at a publishing company, is a literary geek who loves novels. Undeterred by being assigned to a fashion magazine, she continues to propose novel projects, and finally receives a GO sign from the editor-in-chief, who is overwhelmed with her enthusiasm! The delighted Yuzuki immediately went to the very special person she had admired for a long time: Hotaruichi Haguro, a very successful best-selling author. When Yuzuki met Haguro in person, she found him to be a \"handsome novelist\" with a slender height, a sweet mask, and a soft smile. However, Yuzuki's request for a \"romance novel\" is brushed off as \"not interested\". As Yuzuki persists, Haguro, who seems to have an idea, says, \"Can I fall in love with you, Mr. Editor?\" It was a proposal of \"pseudo love\"!"
