   "en": "A manga that “strongly sympathizes” with work!\n\nAs soon as the serialization began on Famitsu.com, it was said that “reading it (too realistic) makes your stomach tingle”, causing a stir mainly in the creative industry. Problematic!\nAs you read on, it's full of sympathetic episodes that make you feel like, \"Oh, this manga is about me at work.\"\n\n\u003cSynopsis\u003e\n“Oh, I got promoted to senior!?”\n\nA 3D animation creator at CyberConnect2, a game development company. Tatsuya Shindo is 30 years old. In his ninth year with the company, he was promoted to middle management playing manager. However, waiting for Tatsuya is Ueda, an older subordinate who lies about his work report, Kuida, a new employee who is motivated but slow at work, and Uokawa, who only thinks about proceeding with work rationally. All the members have their own habits. Every day is a series of trials, but we continue to make games every day for the smiles of our users!!\n\n- \"But I still want to believe in the power of games, because I'm a game creator. \""
