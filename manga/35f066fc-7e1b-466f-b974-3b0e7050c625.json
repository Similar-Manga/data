Princess Sheherazade is sent to marry a vile sultan in order to keep him from conquering her father's kingdom, but she's kidnapped en route by the masked Devil Mariam, who will do what it takes to exact revenge against the sultan – including stealing the virginity of the sultan's pretty bride-to-be…! Published in Chokotto Abunai Koimonogatari.  \n  \n3) Lovers in the Tower that Touches Heaven -  \nRuby, Baghdad's top dancer, is waiting for Jank to return home.
