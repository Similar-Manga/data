   "en": "A poor peasant girl was sold to a brothel in Edo. Her new life started from the day when she had her first full bowl of rice. After many struggles, she became a cultivated oiran. While her beauty never failed, her hope for freedom faded with the passing seasons. Yoshiwara of Edo was a man's heaven, but a woman's hell: all was sakuran.",
   "pl": "Piękno i gracja, liryzm i tajemnica, mądrość i milczenie. Oiran (prostytutka, protoplastka gejszy) ma wiele twarzy. Każdą z nich kształtowano latami. Jednak pod tą garderobą ozdobnych masek jest schowany człowiek. Człowiek - istota omylna, mająca gorsze i lepsze dni, swoje przywary i przyzwyczajenia. Kiedy iluzja się rozmywa pozostaje prawdziwe życie, skąpane w krwi i podstępie."
