   "en": "Toki is a ruthless murderer who lives in the darkness. This man had no past. Where was he born, where did he grow up, what kind of changes did he go through, and is he here now? As if to fill that void, Toki holds up a deadly long sword and continues to commit outrageous acts. A certain request changed Toki's fate. The mystery of the giant Taitara was told by a priest deep in the mountains. Then, a mysterious girl appears and disappears in Toki's dreams. In search of this mysterious girl and the blank past, the battle between Toki and the demons begins. What is the mystery of the giant Daita? What is Toki's hidden destiny? At the end of Shura's deadly battle, what will be the shocking myth that will come? ? Toki's long sword shines, heralding the end of civilization and the restoration of mythology! ! This work was published in Weekly Young Jump in 1989. Also included is the short horror story ``Kodama,'' which was published as a one-shot in 1987. Published by Shueisha in 1990. Total 210 pages."
