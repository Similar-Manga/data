   "en": "Izumi realizes from a young age that his romantic orientation is towards the same sex. Even when he becomes an adult, he hides that fact, and pretends to be like everyone else.\nOne day, on his way home from a business dinner, he gets embraced by a young man who exclaims \"\"It's you, Kou-kun, isn't it...?! I've always wanted to meet you!\"\" The guy in question is his friend he had lost contact with eight years ago, Shion... Who is also the boy he felt guilty towards for being attracted to, and whom he distanced himself from all those years ago.\nQuestioned why they suddenly lost contact, Izumi blurts out that he always loved Shion, to which Shion replies that he feels the same... They end up dating, and they're lovey-dovey and happy, but sometimes Shion's behavior seems off...?"
