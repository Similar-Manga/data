   "en": "The true life of the “universal genius” Leonardo!\n\nLeonardo da Vinci is the author of the world's most famous painting, the Mona Lisa. Born in the Italian village of Vinci, he also left behind various ideas for inventions, experimented with flight, dissected the human body, went on expeditions as a military man, and other fields other than art. However, he is known as the superman who played an active role, and is called the \"genius of all things.'' However, not much is known about his life. For example, although he is famous as a painter, he has only completed a few works, such as ``The Last Supper'' (even ``Mona Lisa'' is still unfinished!), and although he has many ideas for inventions, very few of them were actually created. there is no. There are also many strange things about his life, such as for some reason he wrote in \"mirror script\" with the left and right sides reversed, and he traveled all over Italy 500 years ago before finally dying in France.\n　The learning manga character museum ``Leonardo da Vinci'' approaches the truth of his life. The reason for the many mysteries, the thoughts behind his works, and his mother...\n　If you read this book, you will learn that the life of an \"all-around genius\" was never one filled with success, and that he was more of a \"hard worker\" than a genius. Probably."
