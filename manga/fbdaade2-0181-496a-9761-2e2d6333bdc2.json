   "en": "The first Young Shima Kōsaku prequel series released and the third chronologically.\nOne chapter in the saga of Shima Kōsaku, salaryman at Hatsushiba Electric.  \n  \nIn this part of the series, Kōsaku has just started working at a branch office for the company doing an unexpected amount of menial labor when a chance meeting with the company president leads to his dearest wish being granted as he is transferred to the central office. Not all is well there, though, as he becomes involved in the complicated affairs of his colleagues, whether in business or in romance. In spite of everything, however, he retains his faith in the company and an unflappable optimism."
