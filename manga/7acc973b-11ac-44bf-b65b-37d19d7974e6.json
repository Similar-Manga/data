   "en": "MazinSaga is a manga written and produced by Go Nagai between 1990 and 1998; currently incomplete and up to the sixth volume, it's the summa of Nagai's works, for the complexity of the plot and the treated thematic content.  \nMazinsaga tells the story of the young Koji Kabuto, university student who finds himself having to collect the fruit of the researches of his father, physicist of world-wide reputation who died in mysterious circumstances.  \nThe boy is thus given a powerful artifact, Mazinger Z, the Armor of God."
