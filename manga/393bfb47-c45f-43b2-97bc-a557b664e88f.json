   "en": "*Unrelated to the children's series Sesame Street*\n\nThis is Goma Street. \n\nIt's a small shopping center in the heart of downtown Tokyo. My name is Keiki Fujiya and I'm 18 years old. I go to a prep school to get ready for my college entrance exams, though I'm on-and-off with it. As a hobby, I play in a band, which is super dope. \n\nMy family's been in the grocery trade since way back when during the Meiji era, and we're still carrying on the tradition. We have a warehouse, shrine, and temple, which is super rare to have in Tokyo nowadays. Our household maestro is my old man Konpei, who despite being a fogey is in great shape and very active. \nI'm pretty active myself, but not as much as my pops. \n\nOur family is a lively bunch of Tokyoites. We're also called \"Edokko\" which means \"Children of Edo\", \"Edo\" being an old name for Tokyo. \nReally, it just means we've lived here a few decades from my pops and my pops' pops. \n\nSo who do we have in our humble abode? Well, like I said, there's my pops. To be honest he's a bit of an oddball, a \"Queer Pop\" if you will. We also got a high school student named Karin from Toyama Prefecture living with us.\n\nI don't have a mom anymore, so we're not really used to any kind of \"feminine influence\" in our house.  She's a cute girl - very pretty. I'll let you in on something - It's kind of a secret. But I like to treat her like a kid calling her a \"gaki\" or rather, a brat.\n\nBut sharing a roof with a pretty 16 year old girl really gets my heart pounding. My older bro's a really straight edge. Being the eldest son, he gets all the responsibility and they trained him for it. He'll be getting married soon to a chick named Chitose. She's a real looker, I don't know how he found her! I hope to meet her soon. \n\nThat leaves my grandma, who looks like an apricot. Like one of those palmed fruit that was pickled in Edo way back when - She's three hundred years old! Despite how she looks, she's likes to play pranks and is incredibly fit. She also gets along with Karin.\n\nOur Sesame Street's a real-life comedy set in downtown Tokyo. Players are always entering and leaving the stage. I'll introduce them when the chance comes along. \n\nUntil then, bye."
