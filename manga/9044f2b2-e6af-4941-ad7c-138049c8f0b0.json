   "en": "Igao, who has a strong sense of elitism, secretly has a burning rivalry with Ryuta, who is stubborn but has the drive to take action. Tomato is Ryuta's younger sister who takes care of all the household chores, Kyuri is a scholar type, and Gabo is gluttonous and strong. In addition, the mynah bird Kero and Gori, who looks exactly like Gabo, join the group, and the painful yet fun adventures of Gaboten Island continue. Comment from the publisher \"Adventure Gaboten Island'' is based on the masterpiece \"Fifteen Boys Drifting Chronicles''. A moving story about five boys and girls presented by Fumio Hisamatsu. TBS, which made the authentic science fiction anime \"Super Jetter'' a hit, subsequently planned Japan's first survival anime as a program. \"Adventure Gaboten Island'' aired in 1967, depicting the activities of young boys who bravely survive on a deserted island in the South Sea, and was received with overwhelming sympathy from viewers at the time. The manga version (serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday at the same time as the broadcast) by Fumio Hisamatsu, one of the original authors of the same work, was just as entertaining as the anime. About the author Fumio Hisamatsu (Fumio Hisamatsu) appeared like a comet in his early twenties and was responsible for the settings and original illustrations for TBS's signature anime \"Fujimaru of the Wind,'' \"Super Jetter,'' and \"Adventure Gaboten Island.'' At the same time, as a manga artist, he serializes the above works in real time (Fujimaru = We, Super Jetter \u0026 Gaboten Island = Shonen Sunday). At that time, he was working in the studio during the day to draw original animations, and at night he drew serialized manga."
