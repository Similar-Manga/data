   "en": "After her mother’s death, Princess Rosa endured the abuse of her stepmother, the Queen, but remained determined to become the next queen. One day, while in the royal palace forest, she was attacked by a thug and accidentally unleashed the \"forbidden power\" she had long kept hidden. As a result, following her younger sister Lily's suggestion, she was banished to live with the \"Count of Blood\" in a remote land. The Count, Lambert, though unsociable, had a kind heart, and over time, the two began to grow closer. However, her \"forbidden power\" and an ancient \"pact with the fairies\" made by the kingdom were linked to her fate. Despite the harassment from the Queen and her sister, as well as the weight of her destiny, Rosa grew into a strong and resilient woman. — \"Mother, I'll find my happiness, no matter what.\""
