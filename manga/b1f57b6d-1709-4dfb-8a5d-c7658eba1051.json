Fujishima originally intended to be a draftsman, but took the editorial role after failing to get a drafting apprenticeship. He later became assistant to manga artist [Tatsuya Egawa](https://mangadex.org/author/de33568c-1448-4813-955a-fdafb63ce459/egawa-tatsuya) in the production of the [Be Free!](https://mangadex.org/title/49746f90-d91f-4ae8-a7a3-91b5d89098ca/be-free) manga\n\nIn 1986, he began his first original manga series [You're Under Arrest](https://mangadex.org/title/cb48732c-c607-4612-b6e8-46318051bcf1/taiho-shichau-zo). His second manga series [Oh My Goddess!](https://mangadex.org/title/b973e612-0d54-48f1-844e-9c83c04b009d/ah-my-goddess), also translated as Ah! My Goddess, became Fujishima's most famous work, which made him a household name in Japan. He is also well known as the character designer for several games in the Tales series and Sakura Wars.\n\nHe is known for his love of automobiles and motorcycles, and several of his series and their characters reflect this, such as in éX-Driver and [Toppu GP](https://mangadex.org/title/28ee14d0-52ab-402a-a86b-939e6a575574/toppu-gp)\n\nOn June 29, 2016, the famous 20-year-old cosplayer Nekomu Otogi announced her marriage to Fujishima as well as her pregnancy on her Twitter page. On July 7, 2016, Fujishima confirmed the marriage on his Twitter account.\n\n[YOSHIZUKI Kumichi](https://mangadex.org/author/afca7e03-a6e1-49bf-8775-448da1c8d141/yoshizuki-kumichi) was once his assistant."
