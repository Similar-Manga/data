   "en": "Yuki Shibata, a 19-year-old boy who came to a certain port town, happened to meet a beautiful woman at dusk who was a friendly and unpretentious 21-year-old who was in charge of a pet shop called Inui in a quiet residential area in the mountains. He was a live-in store manager. That night, the boy who helped her, Hayase Yuki, and her puppy collapsed on the street and had a high fever, so they had to stay at the store/residence. When he started working to regain her energy and repay her kindness, the head of the town's Ninkyo Tatsumi group, who had been watching over her since she was a child, admired her skill with dogs and her courage, and while she worked as a store clerk, He ends up staying in the group as a dog handler. The owner of the store returned from a trip and brought back twin infants, and it turned out to be her own infants! This is a slightly adult, pure and heartwarming story in which each person has their own circumstances, and they spend their days caring for each other without asking questions more than necessary."
