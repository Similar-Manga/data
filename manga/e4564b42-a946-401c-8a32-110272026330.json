   "en": "Waseda Meiji, a problem child who is quick to fight but has a strong friendship, is refused admission to his local junior high school and enrolls in the first junior high school that accepts problem children from other school districts. At Ichiban Junior High School, there was a tendency to look down on students from other districts, and as a result, Meiji, a student from another school, was unable to join the baseball team. Meanwhile, Ogata, the ace of the Daiichi Baseball Club, inflicts an injury on former captain Hayakawa because he wants to be active, and he also kicks out members who are not in his circle one after another and takes over the baseball club. Ogata, who was investigated for this, plots to silence Meiji by secretly attacking Meiji with his former baseball team members, but they fail. Meiji, angered by Ogata's methods, establishes a second baseball club and challenges the first baseball club, led by Ogata, to settle everything.."
