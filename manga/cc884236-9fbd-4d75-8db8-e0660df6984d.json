   "en": "From Fifay.net:  \nSumi is in love with Mitsuru, but he doesn't seem to be interested in her as a woman. Determined to look more sexy and mature, Sumi takes an experimental growth hormone that her scientist father has been developing.  \n  \nHowever, the medicine backfires. Instead of changing into a buxom femme fatale, Sumi changes into a beautiful young man! She–he–is so gorgeous and so cool that even Mitsuru begins to take notice. Although the new situation with Mitsuru is imperfect, Sumi discovers that she can be closer to her crush: they can talk man-to-man. Yet, being Mitsuru's friend also has a downside, particularly when he reveals that he is in love with a girl in his grade!"
