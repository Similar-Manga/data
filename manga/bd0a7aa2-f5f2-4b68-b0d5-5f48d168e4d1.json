   "en": "\"You have power, and you are dissatisfied with the world. Would you want to change the world… or would you rather change yourself?” —. Akane Senri.\n\nAmidst a path of thorns can be the calm before the storm. Perhaps, happiness on the road to hell is not a punishment, but a reward promising things to come.\n\nIn the eco-centric city of Kazamatsuri, a boy named Kotarou strives to assert himself in high school and attain an ordinary, peaceful life, but finds himself afflicted by odd phenomena within the city that seem supernatural. In his curiosity, he seeks out the rumored witch of the occult club, Akane Senri, and is inspired to join her club to prove the supernatural exists.\n\nUndeterred by her mysteriously probing questions and prickly nature, Kotarou brings life to the club and even recruits new members, forming a circle of friends in the process. But when they finally find proof, it becomes apparent that these strange events are symptoms of a dying world., and that his friends are hiding secret agendas fated to clash over this very subject.\n\nAfter the club collapses, Kotarou puts his trust in Akane and decides to serve as her shield to aid her work within \"Gaia\"- a cult of environmentalist mages determined to preserve nature at any cost. As Kotarou's actions behind the scenes grow in proportion to Akane's influence and leadership within Gaia, the pair's emotions become increasingly entwined.\n\nFaced with the resolve to turn the whole world against them in order to fulfill their goals, the pair finds unexpected happiness and comfort in each others' company. \n\n(This is a fan comic based on the storyline within Akane's Route of the visual novel titled \"Rewrite”. This work is also a prequel to the doujin \"Dear Secret Rose\")"
