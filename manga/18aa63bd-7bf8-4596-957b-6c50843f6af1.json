   "en": "A strange summer with no cicadas. It occurred suddenly.\nTwo high school students, Yushichi and Airi, are struggling with their future. Yuichi, who lost his parents in an accident, and Airi, who has an awkward relationship with her parents, are good friends. That summer, however, there was a series of strange occurrences of sex workers disappearing in the town. Soon, rumors spread that the cause is an infection caused by an eye-like eczema that pops out from their bodies and is being consumed by \"something\". Airi, who has been harboring an unspeakable secret, is terrified by the unknown rumor, but it is only the beginning of a further threat. A Sisterhood x Panic horror  about girls living under extreme conditions."
