Η γυναίκα του, η Τσίτσι, θέλει να βρει δουλειά, αλλά το μόνο που θέλει να κάνει είναι να εκπαιδεύεται και να πολεμά ισχυρότερους εχθρούς.  Αλλού στο σύμπαν, ο Θεός της Καταστροφής, ο Μπρους, και ο υπηρέτης του ο Γουίς ταξιδεύουν από πλανήτη σε πλανήτη αναζητώντας φαγητό και διασκέδαση.  Αφού ανατινάξει μερικά άτυχα θύματα, ο Μπίρους θυμάται έναν άνθρωπο από τα όνειρά του με το ψευδώνυμο «Σούπερ Σάγιαν Θεος», ή κάτι τέτοιο... Ο Θεός της Καταστροφής βάζει το βλέμμα του στη Γη για να εντοπίσει αυτόν τον μυστηριώδη άνθρωπο!  Ίσως αυτό θα δώσει στον Γκόκου κάτι να κάνει;",

Elsewhere in the universe, the God of Destruction, Beerus, and his attendant Whis are traveling from planet to planet in search of food and entertainment. After blowing up some hapless victims, Beerus is reminded of a man from his dreams with the moniker “Super Saiyan God,” or something like that... The God of Destruction sets his sights on Earth to track down this mysterious man! Maybe this will give Goku something to do?"

    "biography": {
     "en": "**Name In Native Language:** 鳥山明\n\nToriyama Akira (April 5, 1955 – March 1, 2024) was a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball—his best-known work—and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.\n\nHe earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shounen or shoujo manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250–300 million copies worldwide, it is the third best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts."
