Contains two feature-length stories in which Akechi Kogoro, the famous detective created by Edogawa Ranpo, takes on bizarre and difficult cases caused by his two rival monsters. ■ \"Hell's Clown'' (illustration by Hisashi Sekiya) / The corpse of a young woman wrapped in plaster is left behind on the street in broad daylight. And is the clown doll sent to the woman's sister a foretaste of her death? The true identity of the \"clown from hell\" who continues to commit crimes as if to mock Akechi Kogoro is unexpected!? ■ \"Golden Mask\" (illustration by Ryuichiro Kita) / Depicts the deadly battle between the monster Golden Mask and Akechi Kogoro . In the early Showa era, it started with rumors of a mysterious figure wearing a gold mask appearing out of nowhere... There have been a number of reports of sightings of golden masks, including in Ginza and at certain railroad crossings on the Tokaido Line at night. His appearance was described as \"his face was glowing gold, and a line of bright red liquid was flowing from his mouth.'' Who exactly is the Golden Mask? One day, what is the big incident that the Golden Mask finally caused? In addition to the full-length manga, there are also \"Edogawa Ranpo and the Clown of Hell'', ``Introduction to the Kitakyushu City Manga Museum'', and ``Edogawa Ranpo and the Golden Mask''. Also includes special articles such as \"Introducing Edogawa Ranpo Corner at Nabari City Library\". Full of Edogawa Ranpo's unique and bizarre atmosphere, this book is a must-read even if you are not a Ranpo fan!"
