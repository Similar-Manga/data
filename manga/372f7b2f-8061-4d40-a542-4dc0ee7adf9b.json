   "en": "Welsh magister magi in training, Negi Springfield (ten), is sent to complete his magical training in Japan. Although he's an English teacher in an all girls academy, his class is quite extraordinary for normal school girls… middle school girls, 32 of them, average age 14!  \n  \nFeatures the same characters and locations as [Mahou Sensei Negima!](https://mangadex.org/manga/121), however, this series has a different story than the original. The new storyline explains the addition of punctuation to the title."

     "en": " [Blog](https://kenakamatsu.hatenablog.com/) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Akamatsu.Ken) | [Mangaz](https://www.mangaz.com)\n\nKen Akamatsu (赤松 健, Akamatsu Ken, July 5, 1968 -) is a Japanese mangaka from Tokyo. In his teenage years, Akamatsu failed the entrance exam to Tokyo University, and applied for Film Study instead (it is speculated that this is where he got the idea for Love Hina). Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野 亜和, MIZUNO Awa). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated. After a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001.
