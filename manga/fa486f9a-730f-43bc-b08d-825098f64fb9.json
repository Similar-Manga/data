   "en": "“Sorry for... cumming inside after you told me not to.” Hanai, a teacher at a private tutoring school, is troubled by the passionate advances of Ishida, a student of his who failed his college entrance exams the first time around. Why? Because Ishida’s totally his type...!!! If they’d have met outside of school, he would’ve loved to go out with him... On the way home from a disastrous outing at a gay bar, Hanai stops by a convenience store, where it just so happens that Ishida is working at the register!!! “Heeey, you look just like this one guy I know! Why don’t you come play with teacher?” And with that, he accidentally ends up bringing Ishida home...? A slapstick forbidden love comedy between a clumsy, puppy-like gap year student and his timid cram school teacher!"
