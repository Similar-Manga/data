   "en": "This is a full-length girls' manga that was serialized in the magazine Nakayoshi from 1957 to 1959 and received enthusiastic support from readers at the time. This is the story of Yuri, a girl with a strong bond, and her pet dog Pes, who wander across the country despite being repeatedly separated.The themes of love and friendship between parents and children are depicted with lyricism. It depicts the townscape and people of the 1950s,\nand is a valuable work as a record of the scenery and customs of the time. It was also broadcast nationwide as a radio program starring Tomoko Matsushita, and is known for starting the Spitz boom. This work is also valuable as the root of the pet manga that later became a genre of manga. This time, we will be reprinting three of the eight books in one volume. Includes commentary by Taro Minamoto and Tomoko Matsushima at the end of the book."
