   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nIs it okay to kill a bad guy if he's a bad guy? An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth? No. Love thine enemy. That's what the \"New Boy Scouts\" are all about! ----The comrades of the \"New Boy Scouts\" who fight \"evil\" and bring peace back to the world are chosen one by one from each country. What is the test of their ability to act, their judgment, and their sense of ethics in the ultimate situation? ...... Five years before the \"Asahi Shogakusei Shinbun\" edition, Saburo Kazata's exploits appeared in the boys' manga magazine \"Shonen\"! In addition to the title story, two short stories set in the western part of Japan are also included."

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
