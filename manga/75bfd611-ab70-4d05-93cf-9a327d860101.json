   "en": "Based on the original song [Love-colored Ward](http://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT_TEpNRBsk) by OSTER project.  \n  \nOne late night, Miku gets a text from a classmate of hers, saying he’s down with a 38.5*C fever and asks for her help. What should Miku do? Obviously, 38.5 is not much of a fever so why should she even bother worrying? It’d be better to simply ignore it, right? Nevertheless, for some reason, she just has to go see him. Could this be… love?!"
