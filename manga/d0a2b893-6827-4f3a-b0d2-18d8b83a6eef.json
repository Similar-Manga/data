   "en": "“Kagero High School students Shinya Tsurugi and Aimi Shingyoji have been friends since childhood and are now in love with each other . You will be able to see\n　When Shinya also turned around, he had a dream that Manami was a rotting corpse and a dream that Manami was attacked by a monster at the same time.\n　One day, when Shinya was sending Manami, who was unwell, to her house, the two of them were entangled by thugs at the shrine.\n　Shinya uses her body to protect Manami, but she is outnumbered and beaten up.\n　At that time, something entered into her body of Manami, and that something slaughtered the hoodlum.\n　When Shinya came to his senses, Manami was standing still among the scattered corpses that had not retained their original form.\n　Sending her unconscious home, Shinya wonders whether to tell the police about this, but due to the special nature of the case, it will not be reported in the newspapers, and the two will not be suspected.\n　The day after the incident, Aimi went to school as usual, and she didn't remember anything at the shrine.\n　However, sometimes she becomes a different person, showing off her ferocity.\n　What is she hiding in her...?\n　And what does she have to do with Shinya...?"
