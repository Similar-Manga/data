   "en": "Mahimahi the Lungfish was a one-shot manga initially published under \"Toriyama's Animal Chronicles\" (Weekly Shonen Jump 1999, No. 4/5). For this project, Toriyama simply observed his pet lungfish and illustrated his thoughts about its mysterious nature. Don't let that description fool you, though; the author's trademark warm and comical sense of humor is all over this manga, making it a fantastic way to learn about this unique species of fish! However, it's somewhat hard to track down due to never being released as its own comic, leading many to regard it as an elusive masterpiece.",
   "pt-br": "Publicado sem alarde na Weekly Shonen Jump nº 04/ 05 em 1999, Haigyo no Mahi-Mahi é uma das histórias menos conhecidas de Toriyama. Isso se deve principalmente por ela não figurar nas compilações de histórias curtas, o Akira Toriyama Marusaku. Por essas e outras que Haigyo no Mahi-Mahi comumente não aparece nas listas de obras do Toriyama já publicadas.\n\nHaigyo no Mahi Mahi é uma curta história de 9 páginas coloridas. Ela começa com um pequeno tritão peixe-arroz chamado Suisui, que, curioso acerca de um peixe pulmonado chamado Mahi-Mahi, resolve conversar com ela. Daí por diante aprendemos sobre esse curioso peixe pulmonado. Na última página temos o Toribot mostrando diversas espécies de peixes pulmonados pelo mundo. E só!\n\nO comentário semanal dos mangakas nessa Weekly Shonen Jump onde Haigyo no Mahi-Mahi foi publicado trouxe o seguinte comentário do autor:\n\n“O tritão de peixe-arroz Suisui sou eu mesmo!? Aah, eu queria esquecer o trabalho e ir nadar dentro de um aquário”."

     "en": "Akira Toriyama (Japanese: 鳥山 明, Hepburn: Toriyama Akira, born April 5, 1955) is a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball—his best-known work—and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.\n\nHe earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen or shōjo manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250–300 million copies worldwide, it is the third best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.\n\nBorn: April 5, 1955\nDied: March 1, 2024 (age 68 years)"
