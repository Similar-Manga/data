   "en": "The morning after a heavy snowfall, Yu Hirose was knocked down by an icy downhill car after staying up all night on his way home. When he wakes up, he is surprised to find that he has been reborn as a different person with the same last name and an extremely good-looking boy. Furthermore, I live in a situation where the ratio of men and women is unbalanced, with women taking the lead role in society, and the few men who are in a position where it is natural for them to be protected.There are women who have too much sexual desire and want men, and women who are afraid of women and are on the defensive. It was a world in which the composition of men entering the world had been created. Yuu's new school life begins in a world where chastity has been reversed."
