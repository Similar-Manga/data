   "en": "(from MangaUpdates): Chinki has a precognitive dream in which he excavates the Todaiki from the ruins of Angyang in China - a bronze giant that is actually a massive psychokinetic robot. When Chinki discovers Aiai's soul can activate the robot, he dubs himself \"Duke Goblin\" and attempts to use the Todaiki's power to rule to world. Only the priest Tenran and his student Kanichi can stop him and return Aiai's trapped soul to her body.\n\n---\n**Volumes 352 and 353 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
