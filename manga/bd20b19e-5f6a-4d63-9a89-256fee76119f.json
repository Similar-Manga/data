   "en": "On the highway to success, Kureto was enjoying his perfect life at college when he learns that his identical twin brother Akio, a \"bad boy\" held back a year in school and his polar opposite, was hospitalized after getting into a fight. To prevent Akio from getting expelled, his parents and Akio beg him to \"go to school in Akio's place.\" Kureto reluctantly agrees to go to Akio's boys-only high school so that his family situation doesn't get any worse. However, he's instantly alarmed at how all the other students treat him. Though he knew Akio had a reputation for getting into fights, he never would have imagined that his brother was well known for other physical activities too… and it seems like the whole school is in on it! Approached wherever he goes, with nowhere to feel safe… Will he be able to get through this unscathed!?"
