   "en": "A mother who killed her own child and committed suicide. A cold father who is absorbed in her work and doesn't care about her daughters. Murasaki and Hanaho, twin high school sisters with such parents, lived in a small world isolated from society. One day, on a street corner, Hanaho meets a mysterious young man who disguises himself as a pastor, calls himself \"Master,'' and runs the religious organization \"Mary Magdalene.'' Hanaho leaves home and she travels around Japan with the young man. However, the young man was also a swindler who sold tap water as the water of life. Still, she ends up following him. I felt like he could take me somewhere other than here."
