   "en": "In the story, a girl called Mai appears before a boy who happens to hate Christmas. As it turns out he was born on December 24 and thus was named Santa, causing him to hate the holiday. Moreover, as a child, he never had any festive occasions, such as birthday parties. With the power of Christmas, Mai is given the mission to improve his luck and change his views for the better.",
   "pt-br": "Uma garota chamada Mai aparece juntamente com um garoto que odeia o Natal. Este se chama Santa (San-chan) e nasceu no dia 24 de dezembro, sendo esse o motivo de odiar o feriado. Além disso, quando criança, ele nunca teve festas de aniversário. \nCom o poder do Natal, Mai tem a missão de dá-lo sorte e mudar suas visões para melhor. Ela foi mandada para San-chan com a missão de fazê-lo feliz, mas acabou se apaixonando por ele no decorrer do processo. Mai aparece pela primeira vez para Santa como uma garota, estudante do colegial. Posteriormente, quando San-chan começa a acreditar em Papai Noel, Mai ganha poderes natalinos o bastante para mudar sua forma física."

In his teenage years, Akamatsu failed the entrance exam to Tokyo University, and applied for Film Study instead (it is speculated that this is where he got the idea for Love Hina). Eventually, he became famous as an illustrator featured in Comiket (short for Comic Market, a comic convention bi-annually held in Japan). He used the pen name Awa Mizuno (水野 亜和, MIZUNO Awa). Akamatsu, still in college, then proceeded to win the Weekly Shonen Magazine award twice. His \"A Kid's Game for One Summer\" was awarded the coveted 50th Shonen Magazine Newcomer's Award soon after he graduated. After a big hit with A.I. Love You, he finally made a grand success with his new manga, Love Hina. The series appeared in Weekly Shonen Magazine and has been collected in eleven volumes (with fourteen volumes in total), which have sold over 6 million copies in Japan, and received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen in 2001.
