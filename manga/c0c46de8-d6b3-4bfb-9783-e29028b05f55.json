   "en": "A compliment from Mr. Toshinori Otsuki, Managing Director of King Records Co., Ltd., who has produced numerous anime works such as \"Evangelion\"\nThe first and last monster encyclopedia that my father bought me was \"Monster Prince.'' I would buy a 20 yen boomerang at a candy store that would never come back and send it flying over the countryside.\nWhen I was in the second grade of elementary school, I read Sonoda Sensei's \"Akatsuki Sentai'' in the \"Shonen Sunday Summer Special Issue'' and cried at the end. 40 years have passed since then. I'm glad to be alive to see the time when I can read the manga of \"Monster Prince\"!!\n-- Toshinori Otsuki\n\n[Synopsis]\nThe passenger ship carrying Dr. Ibuki's family is sailing in the Pacific Ocean when it sinks due to the eruption of a volcanic island that suddenly appears! Ibuki tries to escape from the ship with his wife and twin sons Takeru and Mitsuru, but Takeru is the only one. was being swallowed up by the rough waves. Ten years later, a huge meteorite crashes near a volcanic island that is still erupting. In order to investigate, Ibuki revisits a place where he has horrible memories, but it has turned into a demonic island inhabited by dinosaurs that were supposed to be extinct and ferocious monsters. The ferocity of the approaching monster. The one who saved the investigation team from a desperate crisis was a mysterious boy who appeared riding a plesiosaur with a roar!\n\n[Commentary] \"\nMonster Prince\" depicts the story of Takeru, a wild child raised by dinosaurs, who, together with his partner brontosaurus \"Nessie\", confronts the planetary birdman and his monsters who are plotting to invade the Earth. This special effects drama was planned by Tokyu Agency, which produced the film, with the premise of exporting it overseas, and was shot with the human resources of P Production, led by Souji Ushio.\n\nThe production cost was unprecedented at the time, and it was aired on the Fuji TV network from October 1960, one year after filming began, to March of the following year. A profound story. Takeru's battle cry is reminiscent of Tarzan. Although Takeru's weapon, the boomerang, became popular among young boys, it did not air for long, but it was a memorable work for viewers.\n\nThis book is the first book compiled from the manga version that was serialized in Shonen King from January 1964, prior to its TV broadcast. The artist was Mitsuyoshi Sonoda, who had a great influence on the world of gekiga with his bold and brilliant action expressions. The powerful monster battles are sure to captivate even those who only know the TV version."
