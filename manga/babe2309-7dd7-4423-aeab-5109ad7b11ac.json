In fact, he was a fallen angel, and if he found the answers to the \"three propositions\" given to him by God, he could return to heaven. It was a difficult question asking what is love? What is death? Six years pass, and one day a woman with twin girls appears at Semyon's shop...\nIn 2020, we live in a world that has completely changed due to the coronavirus pandemic. What do we rely on to support our lives now, and for whom do we live our lives?A 140-year-old masterpiece by a world-renowned literary giant has been revived as a manga, offering hints to the answer."
