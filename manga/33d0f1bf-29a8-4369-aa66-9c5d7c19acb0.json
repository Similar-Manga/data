   "en": "The stage is Ikasama Town and Osawagi Elementary School in Tokyo, and the story begins with the move and transfer of a super-problem child, Takashi Takashi . He's a hard-core troublemaker, and if he gets his hands on it, he'll cause an uproar at any class or event, and most of the film is a slapstick slapstick slapstick depicting his unbridled success. In such a situation, his twin sister who is a person of common sense who admonishes him, Yuuichi Hongo , who he sees as his own rival, and Keiko Mizukoshi , a tomboy teacher , are mixed in. The story unfolds, sometimes getting involved in a commotion, and sometimes rushing into a tough blur. In addition, Kotaro Sasaki , who claims to be Takataka's destined rival, appears in the middle of the work, further expanding the story."
