   "en": "Suwa, a high school student, harbors an unrequired love for his teacher, Kannagi-sensei. Kannagi-sensei is handsome and gentle, with a voice that instantly arouses Suwa. Contrary to appearances, this teacher who looks like he has everything all together is actually an untidy person with no fashion sense, so Suwa must come to his classroom and take care of him. However, since Suwa has passed his class with flying colors, their relationship will soon be over. On the last day of school, Kannagi-sensei suddenly says \"I thought you loved me?\" and forcibly kisses Sawa!?"
