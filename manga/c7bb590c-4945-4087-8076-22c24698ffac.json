   "en": "Tokiwaso's leader \"Terra-san\"'s complete collection project has started! The\nfirst step is to present his masterpiece \"Spokin\" in the first complete edition (all 9 volumes)!!\n*Recorded at the end of the book*\nThat ally talks about “Terra-san” and “Tokiwaso”!\nInterview with Shinichi Suzuki, also known as “Futarou”\n\n[Synopsis]\nKintaro and Momotaro, who live in a fairy village somewhere in Japan, love baseball. They each lead the Yamazaru team and the Kawanagare team in matches, but the match always ends in a draw. So, Kintaro joins the Giants and Momotaro joins the Lions, and they vow to prove themselves on the professional baseball stage.\nAt first, the two are disliked because of their cute appearance, but their superhuman powers are recognized and they finally join the team of their dreams.\nThe famous battle between the great players of yesteryear is revived across time and space!\n\n[Commentary]\nWho is the manga artist Hiroo Terada? Tera-san, the reliable older brother of Tokiwa-sou, appears in \"Manga Michi''. He is a solitary figure who struggled with the current trends in the manga world and ended his career. Both are correct, but there is another answer.\nHe was a person who put his children first and worked hard to write about them.\nIn order to revive that feeling, Manga Shop will regularly publish Tera's works that can no longer be read, starting with this work, \"Sportsman Kintaro.'' Terra is a legendary manga artist who contributed to the development of the manga world with Fujiko Fujio A, Fujiko F. Fujio, Shotaro Ishinomori, Fujio Akatsuka, Shinichi Suzuki, etc., but not only old fans but also Terra from \"Manga Michi\" I would like people who don't know about it to read it without any hesitation. Tera's manga is now a precious manga that everyone can enjoy, that is, it is a \"correct manga.''\n\"Sportsman Kintaro'' is a monumental baseball manga that was serialized for five years, starting with the first issue of \"Shonen Sunday,'' which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009. Kintaro and Momotaro, heroes of fairy tales, join the Giants and Nishitetsu, respectively. It received support for its development of a dream showdown with real players such as Oh, Nagashima, and Kaneda using its superhuman powers, and for its healthy touch, which is a little different from the usual sports genre, and won the first Kodansha Children's Manga Award.\n\nThis reissue is the first complete edition (all 9 volumes) that includes all 239 episodes serialized in \"Shonen Sunday\" and 12 one-shot episodes published in a separate volume. It can be said that this work is suitable as the first part of a complete collection."
