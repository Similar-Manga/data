   "en": "Go Nagai's historical work \"Toshiie Maeda''. It depicts the fierce battles of Nobunaga's vassals, from the encounter between Toshiie and Nobunaga, to the Battle of Okehazama, the Battle of Anegawa, and the burning of Mt. Hiei.\nIt beautifully and splendidly depicts Go Nagai's elegant and powerful \"battle'' scenes,\nas well as Toshiie Maeda's \"obligation,'' \"elegance,'' and \"anguish'' as a Sengoku military commander.\nThe prosperity and fall of the Oda family is clearly depicted from Toshiie Maeda's perspective, making it a great read for readers who love history."
