   "en": "Since the morning incident when he saw Tari's eyes swollen, Ari has been curious. Is it really just because Ari deleted Ata's cellphone number from Tari's cellphone, or is it because of Angga? If it was because of Angga, who was Ari's archenemy, Ari wanted to know what the guy had done to Tari.\n\nAfter finding a shoulder to cry on instead of Angga in Ata, Tari slowly began to forget Angga. Ata's attitude that contradicts Ari makes Tari comfortable with Ata. She confides in Ata, who is gentle, caring, kind, and who only recently realized that she managed to make her heart pound. She ignores Ari's interruptions and intimidation. This is what makes Ari even more wrong-now his rival is not Angga, but his own twin brother.\n\nHowever, when Tari feels that she has found the harbor of her heart, a big secret is slowly revealed. Tari feels... gradually Ata looks more and more like Ari....\n\n(Translated from official synopsis)"
