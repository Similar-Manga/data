   "en": "Kai's son said he wanted to play baseball. Confused, Kai consults with Oka from the Hakata Shimbun. In fact, Kai was a former professional baseball player who was permanently banned from the world of baseball due to suspicion of match-fixing. Oka, who believed in his innocence and continued to write articles defending him, has not written any articles for the past 20 years, and is called \"the Oka who doesn't write.\" Oka advised him to confide everything to the child, and if he was convinced, play catch. Writing an article for the first time in 20 years... An honorable collection of short stories depicting the spirit of a newspaper reporter. Collected work \"From Tamagawa = Mr. Oka who does not write\" and others."
