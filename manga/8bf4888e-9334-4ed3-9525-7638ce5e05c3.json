   "en": "Highly recommended by Yoshikazu Takeuchi! A messenger of\njustice who soars through the skies and soars into space! His name is National Kid !\n\nSynopsis\nSuddenly, a mysterious disk attacked the National Diet Building. The mysterious disk explains that \"Three Z Abbeyka\" from Venus is admonishing the Earth, which has repeatedly conducted atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. A destroyed city, people who develop space sickness one after another. Furthermore, even Dr. Mizuno, who is trying to create a vaccine for the space disease, is kidnapped by \"Three Z Abika\"...\nJust when you think you're in a desperate situation, National Kid appears to confront the saucer!\n\nSpecial commentary by Mr. Yoshikazu Takeuchi\nIn order to protect the justice and peace of the earth, our national kid has fought fierce battles over land, sea and air with monsters and such as the Venusian Inca and the undersea demon Nercon. As soon as it was televised in 1960, it became extremely popular among children. The secret to its popularity is, above all, the coolness of Kid, who can realistically fly around the sky. What supported such a surprising flight scene was special effects technology using a one-shot camera developed by Konishi Roku (currently Konica Minolta), which was groundbreaking at the time. By directly synthesizing the actor who plays Kid and the live-action aerial shot scene, we have created a screen that has never been seen before in the history of television.\nThis popular hero was, of course, made into a manga by master Daiji Ichimine, contributing to the increased circulation of the magazine Bokura. The unique touch of Daiji Ichimine, who took the world by storm with his dynamic style of painting, is full of power and charm that makes your hands sweat even when you read it again now. It is an entertainment work recommended not only for nostalgic manga fans and Ichimine fans, but also for special effects fans and transforming hero fans."
