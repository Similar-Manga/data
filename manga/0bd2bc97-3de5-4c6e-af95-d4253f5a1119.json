   "en": "Yutaro Tomari is a salaried worker who belongs to the management department of the \"Saiko Hotel Group\", which operates a nationwide chain of business hotels. A gentle and simple hotel man, his job is to visit the hotels under his umbrella, investigate sales, and check that operations are being carried out properly. And sometimes, I have to deal with customer troubles that can't be made public.\n　One day during that night, I received an emergency call saying, \"A trouble has occurred at a hotel in Hakata!\" Tomari, who immediately took the Shinkansen and got off at the station in Hakata, accidentally grabbed the breasts of a busty career woman and got slapped.\n　As soon as I arrived, I was strongly baptized as a Hakata woman, but the next day I had to negotiate with the company I was in trouble with, so I had a lot of meetings with the person in charge of the local hotel at a stall in Nakasu. Then, a female customer entered the stall. The breast button on her blouse looks like it's going to burst at any moment--and if you look at it, isn't that the woman who threw up Tomari at the station?! On top of that, she is the person in charge of negotiating for the troubled company. Night, desperate situation!"
