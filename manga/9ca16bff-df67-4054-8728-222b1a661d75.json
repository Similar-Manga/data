Love, Stupid, Me  \nChie wishes that her boyfriend Satoshi would show her more affection, but she knows he doesn't like the clingy type.

Doki-Doki  \nMiyuki's in love with Shuntaro, but she won't confess because she's afraid of ruining their relationship. But when another girl confesses to Shuntaro, something begins to change…  \n  \n4. Too Young  \nMika's mom doesn't approve of her relationship with Yoshiyuki, her boyfriend. In fact, she doesn't approve of anything Mika does, whether it be losing piano contests or getting Bs on her tests. How far will Mika go to protect their love?"
