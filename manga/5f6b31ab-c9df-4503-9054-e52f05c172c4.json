   "en": "There was not a single child in the city where civilization had collapsed. Underneath the building that has been reduced to rubble, an old face can be seen peeking out. Time passes and people reach the end of their finite lives. I thought the world was coming to an end, but then suddenly a new life was born. A new life for the first time in decades, a new successor. However, after the death of old people, what is the fate of the only life left behind...!? (Fish Boy)\n\nA man with no relatives who died after a battle with illness was buried in the dirt on the outskirts of the village, surrounded by his friends. However, mysteriously, after 100 years, the man's consciousness returned to rising from the bottom of a deep lake to the surface. What is the world that a free man sees...!? (A Calm Day) / The business of an old man who runs a stall in the middle of the night is manufacturing and selling tatsumaki. It is said that when it walks through people's streets, it creates an extremely large wind. One day, the boy met the old man... (The Old Man Who Sells Tatsumaki)"
