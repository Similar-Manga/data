   "en": "The story takes place in a world that resembles 19th century Europe. When a carnival comes to town one day, Ray, the son of a bar owner, meets a girl with wings. The girl's name is Vendemiaire. She was given life by her Creator and tells Ray that she is not human.  \n  \nThis is a series of short stories showing the kindness and cruelty of mankind. You can enjoy pictures drawn with a fine touch alongside the philosophic dialogue of the characters.  \n  \nThis 2-volume series is the debut work of Mr. Kitoh. Hints for his next work, Narutaru can also be found in this story."
