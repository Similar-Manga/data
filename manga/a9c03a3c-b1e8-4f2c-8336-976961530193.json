   "en": "I had my share of working overtime for an evil employer. It's no surprise that I died from it! But as if being reborn as Irene Werber, a minor character in a romance novel, wasn't shocking enough, it turns out that my kind older brother is destined to work for the world's most evil superior, Crown Prince Ervin Manuel Terence! It's up to me to stop my brother from being exploited! The only problem is... I don't even know what this prince looks like!\n\n---\n“Your Highness! The papers have piled up like this…!”\n\nI reincarnated as Irene Weber, the younger sister of an aide who is suffering from overtime because of the prince who is in love and neglects his work. Irene, who was buried in work before the reincarnation and died of overwork, intends to protect her beloved brother from such a terrible thing.\n\nNo overtime! No call after work! Evil boss, go away! Work less and earn more, Brother!\n\nTo the end, Irene tries to separate the prince from her brother. A method to win by knowing your enemy and knowing yourself. Irene scraps a little record without leaving any details, of the Prince whose face she doesn’t even know about, for the future. Somehow, her brother’s face, looking at such Irene, is dark…\n\n“Brother, if you’re meeting the Crown Prince today, I’ll go with–”\n\n“Absolutely not.”\n\n'Do you want to meet him alone so much?’\n\n–\n\n“Before that, Benjamin Weber, when can I meet your sister?” \n\n“Not for the rest of your life.”\n\nThe most affectionate brother and sister of the continent. Will the day come when these two siblings can resolve their growing misunderstanding?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%98%A4%EB%9D%BC%EB%B2%84%EB%8B%88%EA%B0%80-%EB%84%88%EB%AC%B4-%EC%88%9C%ED%95%B4%EC%84%9C-%EA%B1%B1%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%B4%EB%8B%A4/2740), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/57906830)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/dont-hire-my-brother-your-highness/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/12981/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%8B%AF%E6%95%91%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%A5%BD%E4%BA%BA%E5%93%A5%E5%93%A5/263)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Do-not-Hire-My-Brother-Your-Highness/67)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/81984)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B8%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87_%E0%B8%97%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9B/305)"
