   "en": "Published in Issue #27, 2019 of Weekly Shonen Sunday, Shinri and Makoto tells the story of Shinri Horikawa -a precociously smart fifth-grader obsessed with 'A-tier' excellence- and Makoto Shijima -an airheaded highschooler as sweet as she is foolish. Together the two form a secret arrangement -every week Shinri tutors Makoto in academics, and in exchange Mako teaches Shinri about the 'low-tier' experiences he's curious about."
