The touching work \"Okaasan Watch Me'', which depicts the bond between siblings, is included in a book for the first time!! Synopsis Sacchan, who is as strong as a boy, is the younger sister of the mischievous Ichitaro-kun and the spoiled Jiro-chan, Omasena. An older sister who takes care of her three younger sisters, Kagami-chan. Sacchan is always in a big pinch when her younger brothers cause trouble! Sometimes she hates her position as the eldest daughter, but they are important to Sacchan... Commentary ``Relief Sacchan'', which has been serialized in \"Fifth Grade'' and \"Sixth Grade Elementary School'' since 1965, is a sitcom by Hisashi Sekiya, who has a reputation for portraying energetic boys and girls. The storyline, in which the main character gets caught up in or becomes the cause of the turmoil around him, is reminiscent of the masterpiece \"Stop! Nii-chan.'' In fact, the author has commented that he drew this work with the idea of ​​it being a girl's version of ``Stop! Nii-chan,'' and this opinion is supported. This time, for the first time, we have included the first episode of ``Relief Sacchan'' and the second half-length work ``Okaasan Watchte'', which depicts the bond between brother and sister, for the first time!"
