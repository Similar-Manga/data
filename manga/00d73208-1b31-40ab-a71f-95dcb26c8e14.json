   "en": "Kyogoku Hinata, a sheltered daughter born and raised in a yakuza house, is ordered to live with her bodyguard Emperor Oga (Taiga Mikado) on the condition that her father allows her to move out. The emperor obeyed the chairman's order, grabbed Hinata's arm as she tried to escape from him, and gave him a serious look, saying, \"It's too dangerous for a young lady alone.\" She finally gave up and Hinata accepted to live with Emperor, but she ran into him naked in the dressing room. There is a \"wolf man\" with bushy fur ears and a tail...! ? As if to add to the bewilderment of Hinata, he provokes her by saying, \"Would you like to check it out by touching it, young lady?\" The emperor, who was found to have wolf blood, was supposed to be in a position to protect the young lady, but he couldn't control his reason because he was in \"estrus\"...! ? A slightly naughty mob romantic comedy about a naive young lady and a fluffy wolf man in heat!"
