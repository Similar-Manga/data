   "en": "Chizuru is a serious public servant who's about to reach her thirties and she was walking in an unfamiliar neon district. It's a rare occasion where she's actually participating in a workplace drinking party but because of her characteristic honesty and sense of justice, she ended up ruining the mood.\n\nFeeling like she shouldn't be there anymore, she decided to not attend the after-party and was on her way back home when she was surrounded by hosts who tried to forcibly make her use their service. Just then, a man she didn't know appeared out of an expensive car and helped her out.\n\n\"You haven't changed at all, Chizuru-chan.\"\n\nAfter talking with the handsome man for a while, she learned that he is actually Tsukasa, her neighbour from when they were children. He's also now the representative for that host club so he can inherit his parents' business.\n\nWhile they were being engrossed in conversation, Chizuru shared with Tsukasa that she wanted to change herself as preparation for marriage. Hearing that, Tsukasa suggested that Chizuru help out at his host club and in exchange, he would help her get more used to men.\n\nChizuru was hesitant at first but decided to trust Tsukasa and agreed to it. Chizuru immediately began to start helping out at the club but Tsukasa's passionate touches left Chizuru unable to hide her bewilderment.\n\nSeems like the love lesson that the high-spec and possesive Tsukasa is giving to Chiziru, who is on the receiving end of his passionate love, will be a bit dangerous and filled with troubles!"
