   "en": "It is said that Magoroku, a master craftsman, forged a single sword that sucked the blood of the Sengoku period into two separate swords, Kanun and Konryu. The one-eyed, one-armed swordsman Sazen Tange, Genzaburo Yagyu, who leads Yagyu Shichinin, the mysterious monk Taiken, and the mysterious master ronin Yamitarō, all gather around these two swords, which seek each other out and bring disaster to those who wield them. A non-stop action that unfolds a fierce competition on the stage of Edo!\n\nThis book contains the complete comicalized version of the period drama novel \"Tange Sazen Inuiunkonryu no Maki\" serialized in \"Shonen King\" magazine since 1967, including the frontispiece. (At the same time, the TV version of Tange, starring Eitaro Matsuyama, was aired on TBS.) Drawn by Satoru Ozawa, a talented man who has worked on numerous marine sci-fi cartoons such as \"Submarine 707.\" You can see the Ozawa style here and there, such as arranging the scenario with the appearance of the original character and giving reality to the strength of Sazen, who has one hand and one eye.\n\nAnd the biggest highlight is that Sazen Tange, one of the best superheroes in period dramas, is depicted as a man who has both strength and weakness and is full of humanity."
