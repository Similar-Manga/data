   "en": "It would not be normal of the Kiku-Tokiwa relationship if there was not any fight between them at anytime. Even their friends/colleague/family were used to seeing them fighting and “calling it off” all the time! Despite of the zillion split-ups and after massive arguments over little things most of the time, the two still managed to go back to each other… In fact, after each argument, it would always be Kiku who went back to Tokiwa as if nothing happened. Tokiwa did not want to show it, but he was worried sick after every fight that their relationship would be really over and done with. He would always be relieved to see Kiku returning to him… until it all started over again in the next round of argument. For Kiku, it was Tokiwa’s “forever teasing attitude” towards her that turned her off. But she would easily melted away and “forgive” him whenever he showed even small signs of tendency towards her. Anyway, life went on, and they still had their fights each time; she had one or two affairs whilst he was feeling insecure; they continued to break-up and patch-up again… But in the course, they would learn a little bit more about themselves and their relationship, and then got to love each other a little bit more thereafter…\n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/84vdd3e/tachibana-kiku-no-amaeta-kankei"
