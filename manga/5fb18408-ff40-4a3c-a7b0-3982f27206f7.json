   "en": "\"Barbara\" was originally serialized by Osamu Tezuka from 1973 to 1974. The original story tells of an encounter between the novelist, Yosuke Mikura, and the mysterious woman with an alcohol addiction, Barbara. In celebration of the live-action film adaptation directed by Makoto Tazuka, Go Nagai, a master artist, brings a unique interpretation of this world. A dream collaboration between the two great masters... Is born here and now!!\n[From the back of the book] \n\nThis story can also be considered a sequel. This time the mystical Barbara has charmed a painter, Kyosuke Mitamura. And later a musician, Goro Nikaido. Both are excellent artist in their own fields but their careers have hit a slump. Is Barbara the remedy for these men's artistic struggles or is she only poison for their work? \n\nIncludes bonus story \"Go and Travel\" about Tezuka’s and Nagai’s trip to San Diego, USA in 1980."

     "en": "Osamu Tezuka (手塚 治虫, b. 手塚 治, Tezuka Osamu; 3 November 1928 – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, and animator. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the Father of Manga\" (マンガの父, Manga no Chichi), \"the Godfather of Manga\" (マンガの教父, Manga no Kyōfu) and \"the God of Manga\" (マンガの神様, Manga no Kami-sama). \n\nTezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his [New Treasure Island](https://mangadex.org/title/63487511-434d-4a98-a1da-13bf80e9fcb8/new-treasure-island-1947) published in 1947. His output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well-received manga series including the children mangas [Astro Boy](https://mangadex.org/title/ca4c84bb-7272-45aa-a22d-dc1282b52372/tetsuwan-atom), [Princess Knight](https://mangadex.org/title/eb1b4f6f-8bc2-40a5-9398-768f5d4aea01/princess-knight-1953) and [Kimba the White Lion](https://mangadex.org/title/bad33763-70c6-40b7-8d14-190556fc55f0/jungle-emperor), and the adult-oriented series [Black Jack](https://mangadex.org/title/fd86eab2-f0f3-47d3-bce5-5628e97f37dc/black-jack), [Phoenix](https://mangadex.org/title/cc647d62-3a2c-474b-ac4e-844256ab185d/hi-no-tori), and [Buddha](https://mangadex.org/title/4e102d46-0a98-4249-8a42-98e4705b663e/buddha), all of which won several awards.\n\nTezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. "
