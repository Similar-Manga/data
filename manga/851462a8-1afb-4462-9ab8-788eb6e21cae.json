   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\n\nRespond to the call for help and avenge the evil! Heroes of an era, forever! \n\nMillionaire Mr. Moukada informs Inspector Fuji that he has been attacked by a murderer! However, the murderer is a murderer depicted in a painting, and he has escaped from the painting. Susumu, Inspector Fuji, and reporter Kurohoshi go to Mr. Moketa's place to keep an eye on the painting.......! What is the mystery of the murderer in the painting? \n\n\"Phantom Detective\" (originally titled \"Boy Detective King\"), serialized in \"Shonen Gaho\" from 1957, is known as one of Jiro Kuwata's best-known works. It was such a big hit that boys at the time were seen making their own black masks out of cardboard and playing with them, yearning to see the \"Phantom Detective\" in his red hat, black mask, and yellow scarf as he took on mysterious cases. It was also dramatized for television and broadcast on the radio for one year from 1959. \n\nIt is also famous that Sayuri Yoshinaga, who had just made her debut, appeared in it regularly. \n\nJiro Kuwata's stardom was propelled by the success of this work, and he became a successful writer with several serials in the same period, including \"Moonlight Mask,\" written by Yasunori Kawauchi, \"X-Man,\" \"Baby Tech,\" and \"Maboroshi Shiro. In other words, it can be said that this is the work that paved the way for the future of Jiro Kuwata, a genius young mangaka."
