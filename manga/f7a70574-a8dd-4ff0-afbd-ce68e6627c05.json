He then reluctantly allows Tsukumo, who no longer has a place to live, to freeload at his home. However, at midnight, Murasaki was attacked by Tsukumo, who was asleep while crying “I’m lonely”?!\nFor the first time in his life, the weredragon reaches his hand to break open the heart of the lonely high school student whom was shrouded in darkness—\n\nThis is a touching story about living together. \n\n**Vol. 2 Summary:** \"Ryuugaeri\" — The phenomenon of people turning into dragons has become an everyday occurrence.\n  \nThe human-turned-weredragon, Tsukumo, and the lonely high school student, Kurogane Murasaki, shared their warmth by snuggling up with each other and became close that they could open their hearts. Tsukumo can feel his heart flutter as he sees Murasaki, who remains close no matter what form he takes. While spending their days in peace interacting with other weredragons and people from the shopping district, one day, Murasaki's uncle, Toono, appeared. He, who comes to visit while Murasaki is away, then said, \"I want you to leave this house for Murasaki's sake,\" to Tsukumo…?! \n\nThe turbulent second season of the kind-hearted and caring weredragon X the lonely, tsundere high-school student!"
