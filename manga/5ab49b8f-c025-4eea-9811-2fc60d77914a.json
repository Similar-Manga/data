   "en": "Mars, a continent of tension where several races live in conflict. On the Mars continent, a successor is born from the'Elyos' that everyone fears. What twins? But is it a joke of fate? Prince'Ans (Angelus)' is born with poor wings, a symbol of the Elyos. For the Elyos who ruled over the continent by defeating God with the power of their wings, the weak wings were no different from being crippled. The Elyos king who wants a strong successor abandons'Ans' and makes Princess'Dea' the successor. Luckily, the abandoned'Ans' was found by a human adoptive parent and grew up lovingly knowing that he was a human being. However, when their adoptive parents were killed by the demons, they decided to become a knight to defeat the demons. On the other hand, Princess Dea, who is raised as a successor to the Elyos, has an inferiority to'Ans' when he compares it with his younger brother'Ans' whose father has been abandoned. In the end,'Dea' tries to stain the Mars continent with blood once more to prove that he is a true successor. 'Ans' organizes an expedition with the human princess, the giant prince, and the demon prince and goes on an adventure to save the world, but representatives of races with different purposes continue to cause conflict. Moreover, I thought he was a human race, but Ans, who was an Elyos, caused even more confusion in the expedition! Who will be the true king of the confused'Mars' continent! The fateful confrontation of two twin brothers and sisters! Large fantasy \u003cMars Electric\u003e!"
