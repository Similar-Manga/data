     "en": "**Name** (in native language)\n寺田克也\n**Birth Date**\nDecember 7, 1963\n**Birth Place**\nTamano (Okayama Prefecture), Japan\n\n---\nFrom Wikipedia:\nKatsuya Terada is probably best known in the United States as the character-designer for the animated film Blood: The Last Vampire. He has also done work related to American comics, such as Iron Man and Hellboy (one of his illustrations was used for an official statuette of Hellboy). He also made additional contributions to old issues of Nintendo Power. In Japan, he is probably best known for the Tantei Jingūji Saburō mystery-adventure video game series.\n\nTerada has defined himself as a \"rakugaki\" artist, more of a philosophy than a style of drawing, in which one draws a little everywhere, all the time, without thinking too much, on notebooks etc. He is a very prolific artist; one of his collections of sketches numbers more than 1000 pages, appropriately called Rakuga King.\n\nHe has done very little group-drawn work (an exception being the manga Saiyukiden Daienou (Monkey King)), his principal activities being illustration and character design.\n\nHis use of CG tools is integrated very well in his illustrations, giving his work a vivid and rich appearance. Most distinctive, though, are the female faces in his work, which could be described as “cute”, but with a dangerous or elusive character to the eyes. He has admitted various influences on his work, particularly European ones, like Jean Giraud (a.k.a. Moebius) and the magazine Métal Hurlant which he has said gave him a taste for strong women who are slightly stripped.\nWon the Seiun Award for Best Artist in 2002."

However, unlike most mangaka, he attended art school for a time and has a classical art education. He disliked oil painting and prefers to work in black and white. He says that he disliked oil painting from the start because of the smell of the paint and employed someone to help himself cheat to get through the course, which he is quite open about in interviews. He never completed the course because he got picked up by Afternoon before he graduated to do Mugen no Juunin.\n\nTOUME Kei and UEDA Hajime were his seniors at Tama Art University manga club, while TAMAOKI Benkyo was his junior. IGARASHI Daisuke was his classmate in oil painting course.\nHe also friends with ENDO Hiroki.\n\nHis influences are TEZUKA Osamu, HOSHINO Yukinobu, ICHINOSEKI Kei, FUJIKO Fujio and TAKAHASHI Rumiko.\n\nHe has also done various illustrations for magazines and EroGuro work. He has an EroGuro book out that is mostly a compilation of some of the work he has created.\n\nHis favorite bands are Ningen Isu, Venom, Iron Maiden, Queen, Black Sabbath and Jitterin’ Jinn."

     "en": "**Name** (in native language)\n寺田克也\n**Birth Date**\nDecember 7, 1963\n**Birth Place**\nTamano (Okayama Prefecture), Japan\n\n---\nFrom Wikipedia:\nKatsuya Terada is probably best known in the United States as the character-designer for the animated film Blood: The Last Vampire. He has also done work related to American comics, such as Iron Man and Hellboy (one of his illustrations was used for an official statuette of Hellboy). He also made additional contributions to old issues of Nintendo Power. In Japan, he is probably best known for the Tantei Jingūji Saburō mystery-adventure video game series.\n\nTerada has defined himself as a \"rakugaki\" artist, more of a philosophy than a style of drawing, in which one draws a little everywhere, all the time, without thinking too much, on notebooks etc. He is a very prolific artist; one of his collections of sketches numbers more than 1000 pages, appropriately called Rakuga King.\n\nHe has done very little group-drawn work (an exception being the manga Saiyukiden Daienou (Monkey King)), his principal activities being illustration and character design.\n\nHis use of CG tools is integrated very well in his illustrations, giving his work a vivid and rich appearance. Most distinctive, though, are the female faces in his work, which could be described as “cute”, but with a dangerous or elusive character to the eyes. He has admitted various influences on his work, particularly European ones, like Jean Giraud (a.k.a. Moebius) and the magazine Métal Hurlant which he has said gave him a taste for strong women who are slightly stripped.\nWon the Seiun Award for Best Artist in 2002."

However, unlike most mangaka, he attended art school for a time and has a classical art education. He disliked oil painting and prefers to work in black and white. He says that he disliked oil painting from the start because of the smell of the paint and employed someone to help himself cheat to get through the course, which he is quite open about in interviews. He never completed the course because he got picked up by Afternoon before he graduated to do Mugen no Juunin.\n\nTOUME Kei and UEDA Hajime were his seniors at Tama Art University manga club, while TAMAOKI Benkyo was his junior. IGARASHI Daisuke was his classmate in oil painting course.\nHe also friends with ENDO Hiroki.\n\nHis influences are TEZUKA Osamu, HOSHINO Yukinobu, ICHINOSEKI Kei, FUJIKO Fujio and TAKAHASHI Rumiko.\n\nHe has also done various illustrations for magazines and EroGuro work. He has an EroGuro book out that is mostly a compilation of some of the work he has created.\n\nHis favorite bands are Ningen Isu, Venom, Iron Maiden, Queen, Black Sabbath and Jitterin’ Jinn."
