   "en": "Hisashi Eguchi makes fun of a whole bunch of dead people in this parody of Tokiwa-sou Seishun. Tokiwa-sou was a legendary 2-story apartment building that housed several noteworthy Manga-ka in the 1950s, most notably Osamu Tezuka and the duo behind the Fujiko Fujio pen name. Stories of Tokiwa-sou have been chronicled in manga such as Tokiwa-sou Monogatari, in which each occupant contributed a short story about their time in the building, as well as Manga Michi, an essay manga by Fujiko Fujio (A)."
