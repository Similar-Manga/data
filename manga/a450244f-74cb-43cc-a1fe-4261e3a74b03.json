   "en": "Volume 1:  \nStory 1 - Like a Lamb, Like a Wolf  \nStraight-laced magazine editor Shizutani Miyako, age 25, has taken every precaution to ensure a steady and predictable life. No surprise is a good one…until she meets Takamura Shuuichi, a photographer with a talent for bringing out the sexual beauty of a woman. Now Miyako is fighting to keep her hard exterior from crumbling (and her nose from bleeding!) over something as flighty as… love?  \n  \nStory 2 - I Want to Lose Myself  \nOffice lady Mayumi passionately loves …her supervisor's work ethic? Her friends think it's weird that Mayumi isn't physically attracted to Kuroiwa, but she's just never thought of him that way… until now that it's been mentioned. One night after that, the two of them are working overtime alone when Kuroiwa accidentally falls asleep, and Mayumi decides to take off his shirt… and then his pants! And the only reason she stops there is because Kuroiwa wakes up! Mayumi's never had the hots like this before! What's an inexperienced girl to do? Especially when she gets found out!  \n(Also included in Yoshihara Yuki the Best Selection)  \n  \nStory 3 - Please Punish Me  \n  \nVolume 2:  \nStory 1 - 1001 Nights with You (1-3 chapters)  \nOoizumi Sonoka is a hard-working OL (office lady) who single-handedly carries the workload of three, so she doesn't have time for love. After being slighted at a subordinate's wedding, though, she gets uncharacteristically drunk. When she wakes up, Sonoko is in bed with a strange man! She's so flustered that she even runs off wearing his pants by mistake! But she can't help feeling that she'd like to see him again… Then, the very next day, her new section chief turns out to be Houjou, the man she slept with!? In an attempt to prove to him that she's not just some lazy, drunken slut–she tries to show him how hard she can work…?  \n  \nStory 2 - He's 100% SILK  \nThe woman president of a women's apparel maker is Yumiko's mother and as a conspiracy sets up Yumiko to a blind date with a man Yumiko thought she met by chance?  \n(Also included in Yoshihara Yuki the Best Selection)  \n  \nVolume 3:  \n1001 Nights with You (4-8 chapters)  \n  \nVolume 4:  \n1001 Nights with You (9-13 chapters)  \n  \nVolume 5:  \nStory 1 - 1001 Nights with You (14-16 chapters)  \n  \nStory 2 - After Black Tea  \n  \nVolume 6:  \nStory 1 - Honey Moon   \nThe continued adventures of Sonoko and Houjou.  \n  \nStory 2 - Though Thou Canst Smell the Colors"
