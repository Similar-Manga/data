   "en": "After World War III, humans developed cerebral engineering, acquired new technology, and reformed their consciousness, changed the Western calendar to the galactic calendar, and built a new civilization. It has become possible to travel back in time by putting a time machine into practical use, separating only the consciousness from the body, and synchronizing it with a person from the past who has similar genes. Time travel was managed by the \"Historical Research Bureau\".\n\nHowever, scholars who advocate the fluidity of history go back in time to change history. The synchronized partner is Jesus of Nazareth from 5000 years ago . Investigator Verdal synchronizes with Simon Peter, one of Jesus' apostles, in order to monitor Jesus' actions and prevent him from changing history .\n\nSimon Werdal monitors Jesus, being careful not to accidentally alter history himself, but without knowing the timing to stop him, Judas is manipulated by Jesus' words and informs the Roman soldiers, will be crucified .\n\nAt that time, an emergency return signal is sent to Werdal. A scholar who was Jesus in the world of the galactic calendar was captured. Werdal meets with the scholar and learns from the scholar of a plan in which the resurrected Jesus will lead the people in an armed struggle to overthrow Rome.\n\nVerdal travels back in time 5,000 years and realizes that it is not Jesus who is being crucified, but a substitute, and finds Jesus hiding and defeats him."
