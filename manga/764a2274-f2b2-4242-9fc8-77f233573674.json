   "en": "Do you have your own favorite restaurant?\nBut, before you know it, it's closed while you're away.\nWhat would you do in such a case?\nGrieve? Find another restaurant? Or, open your own restaurant?\n\nThe two are two different people: Mayako, who is not good at socializing and is only good at being serious, and her cousin Noeru, who is the opposite of Mayako in that she is good at getting under other people's skin.\nThey both love \"Kukuriya,\" a Japanese goods shop with a café attached.\nThey were also close friends with the store manager, Ms. Du Shi, but the store suddenly closed.\nMayako and Eru feel a sense of loss, as if they have lost a precious place in their hearts.\nTo make up for it, they decide to open their own restaurant.\nThis is a \"store\" management story that will make you want to try to open a store yourself!"
