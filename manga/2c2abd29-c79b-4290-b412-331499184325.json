   "en": "“We have a deal, then.”\nThat’s how my life with the devil began, sharing energy through kisses to reward his cooking.\n\nStreamer, Mashiro Uika, ordered food delivery to her home one day, but an unexpected delivery box came instead. She was so excited as she looked at the unfamiliar box! But when she opened it, someone was inside?! Although Uika was still in shock, Berith, who looked like a demon, went to the kitchen and prepared a home-cooked meal. Despite the peculiar situation where a stranger was cooking in her home, she was so hungry that she couldn’t think straight. While she was deep in thought, a delicious-looking meal was served, and the bite she took confirmed it to be tasty!!! Uika completely cleaned the plate, satisfying Berith.\n\n“I’ll take my payment now”, he said, before giving her a kiss…?!\nWhat does he mean by energy? Is he an actual demon??? All I wanted was a food delivery… What is going on…?"
