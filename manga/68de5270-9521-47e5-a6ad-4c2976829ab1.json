   "en": "Messenger from the Moon Moonlight Mask VS Incarnation of Evil The\ncurtain rises on an action-packed adventure revolving around the secret treasure of Satan's Claw Kingdom!!\n\n[Synopsis]\n600 years ago, the Kingdom of Paradise flourished in Southeast Asia. The mysterious monster Satan's Claw, who is aiming for the huge treasure, works behind the scenes to obtain the three keys to the treasure. The great detective Shujuro protects Fujiko, a descendant of the kingdom who has one key, and the messenger of justice, Moonlight Mask, takes out assassins that appear one after another and approaches the true identity of Satan.\n\nAfter a lot of empty and real bargaining, the party chases after Satan, who has obtained all the keys, and enters the former Kingdom of Paradise -- far away in Southeast Asia! The decisive battle begins with Satan's claws, who have set their sights on their ambition to steal the treasure. is being cut!!\n\n[Commentary]\nThe special effects hero drama ``Moonlight Mask'', which was broadcast in 1958, achieved the highest audience rating of 68% and was widely supported as a national drama. Its popularity can be seen from the hit comic and movie adaptations, including by Jiro Kuwata.\n\nIn 1972, the TV anime ``The Lover of Justice: Moonlight Mask'' was broadcast. This work, which was based on a drama, also gained great popularity.\n\nThis work was serialized in \"Shonen King'' at the same time as the anime broadcast, and is a comic version of the first part of the anime, \"Satan's Claws''. The powerful touch of Minetake, who was in charge of the illustrations, gives the paper a sense of realism and the presence of the characters that is comparable to that seen on TV."
