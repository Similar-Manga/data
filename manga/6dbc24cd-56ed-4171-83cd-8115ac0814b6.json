   "en": "On the way home from the third year of middle school. Han Dae-sung falls into hell without any context.\n\nAt first, he wandered in hell for about a few days and despaired, but he said that he had to live. He starts fighting with the determination to return to Earth. Hell was like a game. A UI pop-up window like an RPG game appears in front of your eyes as a hologram, there is a status window, and you learn skills and acquire items. Even though he almost lost his life several times from the ferocious beasts of hell, he persisted and continued to grow. \n\n10 years passed, 50 years passed, and 80 years were taken. He finally defeats the demon, the absolute lord of hell, and ascends to a new seat of power. \n\n[Would you like to return to Earth?] until the message pops up. Hell is worthless. Daesung returns to Earth, feeling no need to stay in this place where there is only a desolate land covered in flames and magical beasts who cannot communicate. \n\nAnd when he wakes up in a hospital in Seoul, he realizes that only 10 years have passed since he fell to hell. Daesung, who was in a vegetative state on Earth for 10 years, receives rehabilitation treatment. \n\nAt that time, a message that could only be seen in hell appears in front of his eyes. [The advent quest has arrived.] He accepts the system provided by hell and completes his rehabilitation training at an explosive pace while carrying out his mission. \n\nWhile hospitalized in his hospital room, Hell gave him quests relentlessly. Daesung's skinny body recovers the body of those days, which was solidified by living in hell for 80 years. Let Daeseong finish his descent. The system of Hell invites them to the other side of the world called 'Pantheon'.\n\n 'Pantheon' Based on the diary Daeseong wrote in his selfishness, the time and space of hell are recreated. Demonic beasts imprisoned in all the English spaces of Pandaemonium beg Daesung, the absolute, to save them. However, with the cold-hearted reply, \"Fuck Daesung\". He himself declares that he will not fight anymore and will live normally. \n\nHowever, the hometown Earth, which should be peaceful, was in a state of air raids by beings from another alien dimension, and the 'great upheaval' began on the day Daesung fell into hell. Since then, in the earth of cataclysm, in order to counteract the monsters that have entered the earth, a monster-specialized monster extermination certificate called 'Hunter' has been created. \n\nDaesung, who promised to live a normal life without fighting, makes one decision. home just returned. To protect the barely reunited family, the enemies from that extraterrestrial dimension must be exterminated. \n\nHaving made up his mind to become a hunter, he goes back and forth to the Pantheon and unlocks the powers of hell one by one. and your own world. He shows the real 'hell' as the absolute of hell to all who threaten his precious people."
