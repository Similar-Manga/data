   "en": "In the underground city of Komun, there were two races, the Ekim and the Gaim, who lived separately due to differences in thought. The Ekim tribe lives peacefully in the depths of the earth and loves peace. I didn't. Since the balance of force was maintained by force, peace continued on the surface and underground, but due to the excessive development of underground resources and the excavation of mineral resources on the surface, the balance of the natural world collapsed, and the Ekim tribe was affected. It allows the Gaim tribe to invade the ground.\n\nIn 1984, a mysterious crustal movement occurred in various parts of the earth, and the actual situation could not be grasped. The damage is huge, and many large cities are destroyed in an instant by tsunamis and earthquakes. Many of the big cities had military facilities, so tensions ran between countries. Despite the global incident, Japan was not affected, but one day, two giant Gaim mechanical insects suddenly appeared in the Shinjuku subcenter, which was crowded with many people, and destroyed the ground one after another. It began to. At the last moment when Tokyo seems to be destroyed, a new mechanical insect appears in front of him, helps Mamoru, and repels the two mechanical insects. The boy who came out of the mechanical insect lying in front of him explained that he was Kalim, the leader of the beetle corps, Beatlas, and that he came from the underground city of Komun. He asks Mamoru to become the leader of the Beetle Corps, Beatlas, and dies."
