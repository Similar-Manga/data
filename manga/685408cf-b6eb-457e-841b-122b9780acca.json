     "en": " Name (in native language)\n沙村広明\n\nAssociated Names\nTAKEI Teashi\nХироаки Самура\nฮิโรอากิ ซามูระ\n沙村广明\n竹易てあし\n\nBirth Place\nChiba, Japan\n\nBirth Date\nFebruary 17, 1970\n\nSamura says that he always wanted to be a manga artist. However, unlike most mangaka, he attended art school for a time and has a classical art education. He disliked oil painting and prefers to work in black and white. He says that he disliked oil painting from the start because of the smell of the paint and employed someone to help himself cheat to get through the course, which he is quite open about in interviews. He never completed the course because he got picked up by Afternoon before he graduated to do Mugen no Juunin.\n\nTOUME Kei and UEDA Hajime were his seniors at Tama Art University manga club, while TAMAOKI Benkyo was his junior. IGARASHI Daisuke was his classmate in oil painting course.\nHe also friends with ENDO Hiroki.\n\nHis influences are TEZUKA Osamu, HOSHINO Yukinobu, ICHINOSEKI Kei, FUJIKO Fujio and TAKAHASHI Rumiko.\n\nHe has also done various illustrations for magazines and EroGuro work. He has an EroGuro book out that is mostly a compilation of some of the work he has created.\n\nHis favorite bands are Ningen Isu, Venom, Iron Maiden, Queen, Black Sabbath and Jitterin’ Jinn."
