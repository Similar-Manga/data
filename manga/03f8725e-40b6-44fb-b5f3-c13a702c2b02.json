     "en": "**Alt names**:\n鶴田謙二\n\n---\nDuring his formative years in university as a student of optical science, Tsuruta, who had initially wanted to be a photographer, had been inspired by the works of numerous science fiction authors, such as Robert A. Heinlein, and manga artists, such as [Hoshino Yukinobu](https://mangadex.org/author/706826f2-20a1-413f-a874-706f1b1f64f0) and his manga [Saber Tiger](https://mangadex.org/title/af8a97fb-3098-4833-90b3-7fceffe231d1), which had inspired him to create manga. He has also cited [Chiba Tetsuya](https://mangadex.org/author/bb386677-86cf-43ee-bc3d-28f3bb4bdf4e) and his manga among his inspirations.\n\nSoon after graduating, he wrote numerous doujinshi and was an assistant to numerous manga artists, prior to making his debut as a professional manga artist. In 1986, Tsuruta made his professional debut, authoring his first manga series, the short work, *Hirokute Suteki na Uchuu janai ka?* (広くてすてきな宇宙じゃないか?, a.k.a. What a Big Wonderful Universe It Is), which was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Morning seinen magazine, set in a world where the land was sinking into water. Tsuruta has cited that the inspiration to this debut work of his came during a train journey from Tokyo to the ocean at Odawara, during which he had seen numerous rice paddies and thought of the possibility of a train line passing through the ocean, after which he wanted to create a work where he could use this image.\n\nSoon after, Tsuruta authored [Spirit of Wonder](https://mangadex.org/title/39187992-cd1f-4095-9f25-cc532b938393), among his most famous works, in which he applied many of his inspirations, which was serialized in Kodansha's seinen magazines Weekly Morning and Afternoon between 1987 and 1996, and was later adapted into an anime series.\n\nAfter Spirit of Wonder, Tsuruta wrote short manga works, and also illustrated numerous art books, which were quite successful. In 2002, he provided the character designs for the anime series Abenobashi Mahō Shōtengai and also authored its manga adaptation.\n\nIn 2000, 2001 and 2013, Tsuruta received the 31st, 32nd and 44th Seiun Awards for outstanding artist of the year. He has also received the Hayakawa Award for best illustrator, in 2000."
