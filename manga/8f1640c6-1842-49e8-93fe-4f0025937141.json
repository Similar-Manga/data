   "en": "Tokyo Bayside on holiday. A criminal with a gun escapes into a large maze attraction and takes a child hostage. At that time, detective Bull of the Bayside Police Station was lying around, and a bullet was shot through the maze's plank, knocking out the criminal. The main character of the new detective, Yashadan, fired the shot. The criminal is taken to Bayside Police Station, but his fellow terrorists rush to rescue him in an armed helicopter and shoot Bayside Police Station. The culprit who was forced to hand over was attacked by bullets and bulls this time. The two of them use a car to avoid the hot pursuit and guide the helicopter to Marunouchi , which has lost popularity on holidays. Shoot the anti-tank rifle at the gap and shoot it down. A detective duo, Dan and Bull, was born, and the battle against criminals began."
