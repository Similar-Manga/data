   "en": "Inugai Hajime is a student at the H University medical school, and he dreams of becoming a clinical doctor. However, for some reason, he's been assigned to work in a forensic medical science lab, under a weird, but incredibly skilled, associate professor called Kiriyama Yuki. Hajime hadn't expected his 'patients' to be corpses undergoing autopsy, and he most certainly didn't expect the first case he attended to with Kiriyama would be the apparent suicide of a girl he knew. During their investigation of the case, Hajime also began to see flashes of the dead girl, as if she had come back to life for mere moments. Will Hajime be able to handle his time in forensic medicine, and work his way back to having living patients? [tethysdust]"
