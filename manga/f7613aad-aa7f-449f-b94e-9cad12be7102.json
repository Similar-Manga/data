   "en": "What if it's a hidden history book of Japan! ? An astonishing story left behind by Matsuyoshi, a close aide to a great man who changed history!\n\nIn the early 1940s, Gentaro's grandfather, Matsuyoshi, came to live in his parents' house.  All of his belongings were luxurious, and his behavior was full of elegance, making him an ordinary person. No atmosphere. The young Gentaro loved Matsuyoshi so much that he had a reserved seat on his lap. As time passes, what Gentaro hears from his parents after Matsuyoshi's death is an astonishing story!! In the turbulent times of Japan. Who is Matsuyoshi, the person he had a close relationship with...!? A true story essay manga written by Taro Minamoto about his grandfather, Matsuyoshi Urushibara. Although it was serialized in Shonen Gahosha's historical drama manga magazine ``Zanki'', the magazine was discontinued before it was published as a book. This work, which was only distributed as a 2-volume doujinshi, has been published as a book by combining volumes 1 and 2!"
