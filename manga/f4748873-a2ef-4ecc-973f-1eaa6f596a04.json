   "en": "It had been three years since her debut in the social circle. The daughter of a count, Melfiera, had been the subject of unpleasant rumours due to her hobby, and was unable to even get engaged. She was told by her father's future wife, who did not think well of her, that if she did not find a fiancé within a year, she would be sent to a convent.\n\nHearing that, she rushed to attend the autumn party. The truth was, she was not really into it, so she found herself alone at the party where she met the others. In the midst of this, she was attacked by a demonic beast that had been infected by a demonic poison and had gone mad. The man who saved her from the desperate situation was a bloodied man who smiled fearlessly. In fact, this man was the Duke of Galbraith himself, who was also known as the \"Mad Duke.\"\n\nDuke Galbraith was intrigued by Melfiera, who was not afraid of demons, let alone his bloodied self. Not only did he show understanding for her unspoken hobby of tasting demons and mutant plants—but he also offered to satisfy her incessant need for exploration…?!\n\nSuddenly engaged! Marriage? I'm being cheated on?!\n\nAn evil gluttonous lady who eats demons for the sake of her curiosity, and a mad-blooded duke who exterminates demons in his domain. A fantasy romance about two people swept up in malicious rumours and unable to get proper engagements, until they find happiness!",
