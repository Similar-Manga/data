   "en": "197×Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture, there were babies born at the same time at 1:01 on January 1st. They are Daisaku Oeda and Craftsman Tadokoro. Both of his fathers were master carpenters who ran a construction company. Daisaku, who was innocent and by far the most naughty, spent his childhood quiet and hidden from the public eye. Saku is called Daisaku's positive and dark craft, and Daisaku gradually shows his abilities. However, it was the second semester of the third year of elementary school. When I built Matsumoto Castle as part of my craft homework, I found a glimpse of something big in my craft... A passionate architecture manga about two people who aim to become master carpenters!"
