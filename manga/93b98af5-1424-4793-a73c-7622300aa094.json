   "en": "At times hilarious, at others heartwarming, this collection of short stories penned by one of Japan's most talented artists is a perfect addition to any library! A young girl discovers that new glasses give her a whole new perspective on the world, a bunny-girl waitress learns to cope with her male customers with dignity, an introverted art student inspires her fellow club members even as she takes inspiration from them, and more! Fans of Mori will enjoy seeing concept designs and historical notes from her award-winning series, Emma and A Bride's Story, as well as Mori's own brand of enthusiastic commentary throughout."
