   "en": "At Usa Branch School in Kochi Prefecture Amimoto's son, who attends school, has narrow shoulders. This is because people who attend branch schools are thought to be a bunch of idiots who didn't pass the main school's exams. However, he also had a dream. That is to enter the University of Tokyo. He wants to enter the University of Tokyo and show the world that there is a fine high school in Usa town. Meanwhile, Arihiro, the son of a fisherman, is living his high school life without any particular aspirations. However, he is attracted by the words of the baseball club coach, ``He is fighting with the spirit that even a branch school in a fishing town can do it,'' and from that day on, he begins practicing hard with the aim of competing in Koshien. However, at the fisheries high school, there\nwas a three-month marine training course that could be considered a handicap for\nhigh school baseball players"
