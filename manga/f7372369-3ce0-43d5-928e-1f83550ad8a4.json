   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nOne day, a young boy, Susumu Katagiri, witnesses a hit-and-run. The victim, an old man, entrusted him with a mysterious switch before he drew his last breath. It was \"Call M\", which can call a robot named \"Seven\"! Susumu is puzzled by the fact that Seven can only listen to the commands of the person who presses \"Call M\" and can be either evil or good, but he is attacked by a gang of people who are after \"Call M.\" ......!? In addition to the title story, this masterpiece collection includes four short stories, including \"Time Patrol\"."

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
