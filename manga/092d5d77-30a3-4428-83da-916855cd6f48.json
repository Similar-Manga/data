   "en": "One day, some humans woke up to find that they now had stretchy arms. After developing technology to have them maintain their shape and form while still able to stretch, humanity took the next logical step and created a tournament where humans with the ARMS gene could beat each other up.   \n  \nBased on the hit Nintendo Switch game, join Spring Man, Ribbon Girl, and others as they have ARMS-related antics!"
