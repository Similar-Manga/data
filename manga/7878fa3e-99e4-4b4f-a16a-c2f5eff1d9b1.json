     "en": "三浦 建太郎, Kentarou Miura was born in Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan in 1966. He was left-handed. In 1976, at the early age of 10, Miura made his first manga, titled Miuranger, which was published for his classmates in a school publication; the manga ended up spanning 40 volumes. In 1977, Miura created his second manga titled Ken e No Michi (The Way to the Sword), using Indian ink for the first time. \n\nIn 1988, Miura bounced back with a 48-page manga known as Berserk Prototype, as an introduction to the current Berserk fantasy world.\n\nIn 1989, as a collaboration with writer [Buronson](https://mangadex.org/author/9be55a5a-2512-447b-9847-16169e44aeaf/buronson) and illustrated by Miura, Ourou was published in the Monthly Animal House magazine. In the following year, a sequel titled Ourouden was published in the same magazine. In the same year 1989, the 6th issue of the Monthly Animal House, the first issue of the solo project Berserk was released with relatively limited success. Miura again collaborated with Buronson on a manga titled Japan that was published in Young Animal from the 1st issue to the 8th of 1992, and was later released as a stand-alone tankoubon. Miura's fame grew after Berserk was serialized in Young Animal in 1992 with the release of \"The Golden Age\" story arc of Berserk, and the huge success of his masterpiece made him one of the most prominent contemporary mangaka. At this time, Miura dedicated himself solely to work on Berserk. He indicated, however, that he intended to publish more manga in the future.\n\nMiura provided the designs for the Vocaloid Kamui Gakupo, whose voice is taken from the Japanese singer and actor, Gackt.\n\nKentarou Miura died on May 6, 2021 due to an acute aortic dissection at 54 years old."
