His real name, written in the Japanese order with the family name before the given name, is OOGURE Ito, which is pronounced similarly to the Japanese rendering of the English words \"Oh great,\" Oogureeto [oːɡuɽeːto], with the only difference being the extended E. Furthermore, \"oh\" can mean king in Japanese, making it possible to read the name as \"the great king\".\n\nCharacteristics of Ito's style include violent plots, the use of English words amidst kanji, and a parade of beautiful female characters.\n\nIn 2006, he received the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen for Air Gear. Ito also created the adult series Silky Whip (Official English Title).
