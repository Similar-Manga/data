However, after graduating I decided to follow my passion for comics and debuted with my one shot “Broken Watch” in Summer of Manga 2021. I love Japanese manga ranging from serious seinen to heartwarming slice-of-life stories. The desire to capture not only action but also emotions of the characters, as well as cinematographic backgrounds is what describes my art. I like listening to music, playing drums, skateboarding, and binging manga series in my free time.”\n\n[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/aruunas)\n\nCrowdfunding:\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/aruunas)\n\nSocial:\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aruunas_art/)"
