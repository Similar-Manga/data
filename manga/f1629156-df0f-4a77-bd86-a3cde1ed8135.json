   "en": "Mei, an inexperienced and editor, is assigned to the writer of her dreams, Yu Kurosawa. Mei goes out for a drink by herself to celebrate, and Yu, a handsome man with a dark side, sits down next to her. The two hit it off as they chat. Mei, who is too naive to control herself, runs away and has a one-night stand with Yuu....The next morning, however, she discovers that Yuu is Kurosawa Yu! Mei is so upset that she leaves the hotel, but three days later, Yuu shows up at a meeting with a nonchalant look on his face and confesses that he has insomnia due to a certain trauma. However, he said that he did not have insomnia only on the nights he was with Mei. Hearing this, Mei volunteered to be Yuu's \"partner for the night\"...? For work? For work or for love? A one-night stand leads to an impassioned, sweet love affair!"
