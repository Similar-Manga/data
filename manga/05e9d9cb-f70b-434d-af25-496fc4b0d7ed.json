   "en": "It will be Motoyama Kazuki's debut work in a boys' magazine. From April 1979, three works continued as a one-shot series in Weekly Shonen Jump (Shueisha). I drew it when I was told to make a work like the boy version \"Futen no Tora-san\". These days we see a lot of long titles, but at the time it was rare and the deputy editor-in-chief liked it. It would have continued more if there was no transfer to Shonen Magazine (Kodansha). \"Decisive Maru\" is a coined word that was used by Motoka Murakami, the wife of senior high school student (she likes \"Futen no Tora-san\"), when she was in college. It's a pity that another work I drew for the weekly serialization, \"Enter! Yamato Spirits\", was published all at once in a special edition, so I had to write it as \"The Greatest Hope of the 80's\", but it was moved to another magazine. disappointing!"
