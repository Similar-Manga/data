   "en": "King Grey is a remarkable ruler with a prosperous reign, and yet…opulence and success cannot bury emptiness and solitude. His time as king, however, comes to an abrupt end, and he reincarnates as Arthur Leywin—a baby born in a world of magic and monsters. Equipped with memories of his previous life and the desire to protect the newfound warmth surrounding him, Art begins his journey of becoming a strong warrior once again. Sword training, mana coreformation, magic studies—Art does it all in order to be as powerful as can be! But will it be enough to repel the dangerous forces that threaten his second chance at life…?\n\n(Source: yenpress)",

     "en": "Brandon Lee, pen name TurtleMe, is the author of The Beginning After The End Novel and writer for The Beginning After The End Webcomic.\n\nBrandon grew up holing himself in the darkest and most secluded corners of his local Barnes \u0026 Noble while reading fantasy novels for hours. The novels provided solace for him throughout the stresses of high school, college, and his job. He has a major in Psychology in order to go into HR to working in finance.\n\nWearing the mask of TurtleMe, he has progressed from his title as a Berkeley graduate and discarded his identity as a corporate worker and delved into the world of fantasy. As a recognized web serial author for over three years, TurtleMe brings together a mix of traditional literature alongside fast-paced installments into his novel \"The Beginning After The End\", an epic fantasy starting from the rebirth of a king into a new life of magic and twisted fate. He has a fondness for books, comics, games and going on walks with his wonderful fiancée, Grace, and his devious dog, Roy. Today, he's a self-published author on Amazon Kindle and Tapas.\n\nBorn in Korea, Brandon currently resides in the Greater Seattle Area in Washington.\n\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/TurtleMe)"
