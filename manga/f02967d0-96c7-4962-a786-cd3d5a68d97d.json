   "en": "Akira is the daughter of the CEO at a newspaper company, and she works there as the editor-in-chief. She is respected by her subordinates for her perfect work ethic, but outside work, she has no life skills at all! She survives on bentos and beer from the convenience store, littered around her messy home. One day, she ran into Kyosuke, a young man who had collapsed at the entrance of her apartment. When Akira took him in, he begged her with the gaze of an adoring puppy, \"Please, I have nowhere else to go...\" He turned out to be good at housework, so she decided to hire him as a live-in housekeeper! However, Kyosuke has a hidden side, with secrets of his own...? Be careful of his duality! A dangerous love story between a puppy-dog young man and a career-woman inexperienced at love, living together under one roof.\n\n(Source: Mecha Comic, translated)"
