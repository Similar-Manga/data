   "en": "Removing friendship from life is like\nremoving the sun from the world.\n--Cicero (AC106-AC43)\n\nWhat is friendship?\nThe king of gekiga, Ikki Kajiwara, has finally reprinted the phantom youth epic that takes on the theme of friendship head-on!!\n\n[Explanation]\nA catalyst for the slumping \"Shonen Gaho\" \"Friendship Mountains'', which began serialization in 1969, is a passionate friendship epic with the original story written by the well-known master Ikki Kajiwara, and the up-and-coming Hidemi Fukuhara selected as the illustrator. The story, which has a consistent theme of \"What is friendship?'', develops while thoroughly denying the self-centeredness and rationalism that were prevalent in society at the time. It's a work full of Ikki-ism... no, it's full-on! Also, one of the highlights is that the words of historical figures are quoted throughout the work.\nI would like many manga fans to experience this \"bible of friendship'' that quietly but surely shined in the history of manga.\n\n[Synopsis]\nShinpei Ryoma, a hot-blooded man who transferred from Kochi to a junior high school in Tokyo, dreams of joining hands with big-hearted men and building wonderful friendships like the series of mountains.\nRyoma acts without compromising his beliefs. As if to ridicule him, the boss, Kurokoma, and the rich and talented Katsura plot various sabotages...Ryoma overcomes difficulties and builds a mountain of true friendship in the metropolis of Tokyo, where rationalism and home ownership are prevalent. Can you give it to me!?"
