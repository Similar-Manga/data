His goal? Plant seeds, and have them flower on the land, no matter what.\n- **Decisive Battle at Cannibal's Cape** (人食岬の決戦, Hito-shoku Misaki no Kessen): A team of soldiers is weary from long battle on an island. Some are willing to go to great extremes - even if it means some may be expendable...\n- **The Ghost of the Jet Base** (ジェット基地の幽霊, Jet Kichi no Yūrei): Detective Hazama is called to investigate paranormal activity at an air base, but finds himself wrapped up in more than he bargained for.\n- **Fire Valley** (火の谷, Hi no Tani): In the Wild West, a young boy searches for the man who killed his father.  Rumors of a cursed yet powerful pistol are about - one said to literally be possessed by a demon - and they interest the men of the local saloon. What connection could there be?\n- **Tatsumaki Voyage Log** (タツマキ号航海記, Tatsumaki-gō Kōkaigi): Shichiro is a boy who lives by the sea, and was found as a baby in an abandoned ship. One day, he learns that he is not his parents' blood son, which causes him great distress. Not long after, the red algae that are a key source of revenue in his town are dying off. What begins as an investigation of the cause turns out to be a long journey linked to Shichiro's heritage.\n- **Wings and Stardust** (羽と星くず, Hane to Hoshikuzu): An emonogatari. A pair of wings made of a mysterious substance are found in the stratosphere by an astronaut. Through a tumultuous string of events, they end up in the possession of the young Kazuo. But there are other parties interested in Kazuo's wings as well - yet Kazuo only wishes to have the wings better the lives of his community. And so Kazuo goes on his own journey, his fate bound with the wings...\n\n---\n**Volume 319 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
