Tasuke and his friend Kazuya decided to sneak into his house and they discovered that he had made a deal with a goddess! In exchange for 50 years of his life, he was to be granted a single wishâ€¦ but the wish came too late. The goddess agreed to just grant his wish to Tasuke instead. Now Tasuke has a right arm that can perform a Rocket Punch! Will Kazuya and the goddess be able to convince him to use his new power as an ally of justice?"
