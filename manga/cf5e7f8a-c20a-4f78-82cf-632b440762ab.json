   "en": "Natsuo wants more views on the videos he and his friend post to I-tube! He's a happy-go-lucky, super-positive kind of guy who is in charge of coming up with content for the videos that get put up. The editor Ichiya, on the other hand, has a cool attitude and a sharp tongue. Both Natsuo and Ichiya are in university and have barely enough funds to get by. So, in an effort to save money while trying to gain more popularity on I-tube, they decide to become roommates. After moving in together, they post a video showing their apartment to the internet, and the comments immediately take a surprising turn, with people calling them cute and implying they are in a relationship. As the video takes off, Natsuo realizes this is a great opportunity and convinces Ichiya to start going with it and pretending to be a couple. But, it only takes so long before the pretense starts to actually, kinda, become reality...!?"
