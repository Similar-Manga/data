   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nBakuro, a.k.a. Kazamatsuri Kuro, wanders around town with a bag in his hand. But when he walks through town, not only beautiful women, but also men come up to him. It seems that they are after the contents of the bag of Bakuro, the sergeant of a large conglomerate. ......? This is a story about money and women in the 1970s, which the creator himself says, \"This is a rare \"sex-focused\" manga\" that I remember fondly.\""

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
