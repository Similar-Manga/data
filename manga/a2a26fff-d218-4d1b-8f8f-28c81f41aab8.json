   "en": "In the era of cavemen, a boy with white skin is born on the night of a storm. He is immediately outcast as a cursed child, doomed to bring disaster to whoever he comes across. This boy is set to be sacrificed to the Dragon King (a Tyrannosaurus), but is saved by an ape woman, Kitty, and is given the name Ryu. \n\nRyu grows up as her child, and soon encounters the world of the cavemen again - with Kitty dying in a skirmish between them and the Dragon King. Ryu soon learns that Kitty is not his birth mother, though she is somewhere out in the world. Faced with this mystery, Ryu ventures on a journey to seek her - all while dealing with discrimination from other cavemen, and the ever-present danger of the prehistoric era.\n\nThe first part of the Ryu Trilogy.\n\n**Links:**  \n- [Anime Adaptation on ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1463)"

Like most of the Japanese artists, Ishimori was influenced by Tezuka Osamu. In 1956, he formed a coterie group with Akatsuka Fujio, Nagashima Shinji and Suzuki Mitsuaki. He moved to Tokyo after graduation, where he continued to work as a mangaka, starting with the war story Kaiketsu Harimao in 1959. Subsequently, he produced hit mangas such as the science fiction series Cyborg 009 (1964) and the historical series Sabu to Ichi Torimono Hikae (Big Comic, 1968-72). In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category. In 1989, he commenced working on a large series about the history of Japan, Manga Nihon no Rekishi, which remained unfinished due to the artist's death on January 28th, 1998 at the age of 60.\n\nIshinomori was nicknamed the 'King of Manga' and is considered one of the pioneers of modern manga.
