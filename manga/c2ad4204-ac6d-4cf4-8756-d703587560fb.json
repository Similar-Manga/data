   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nYuki, who grew up in an orphanage, is a tomboyish but kind-hearted girl. One day, she is adopted by the Iwabuchi family, a wealthy family who came looking for an adoptive daughter. Yuki begins a new life as a daughter, but she is not so easy to please! Yuki was so taken by a picture of Hokkaido that she ran out of the mansion and hopped on a plane to Hokkaido! A touching work that beautifully depicts the heart to heart exchange!"
