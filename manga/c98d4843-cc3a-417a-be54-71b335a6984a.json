   "en": "Clearly, God must have been joking when he sent down another oracle proclaiming that “the companion of His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, is to be the precious daughter of Marquis Lurhtella.” How could the oracle be mistaken?\n\nAs soon as I was born, I was selected to be the Crown Princess and have spent my entire life training to be a great Empress one day, but everything changed overnight: My power, my status, and the way people look at me. I thought only his love wouldn’t change, however, he did not hesitate to notify me of the breaking of our engagement, and that is how it ended between us. Giving up everything was a lot easier than I thought. But…\n\n“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Princess Pesentria.”\n\n“…”\n\n“Speaking of the owner of the temple, I wonder if you remember me.”\n\nHe, who had the greatest divine power in the Empire, reached out to me. Can I hold his hand?\n\n---\nAs the chosen one prophesized to bring stability to the empire, Ersia Fesentera had lived her entire life as the future crown princess... until it is revealed that another girl is the chosen one. In a day, Ersia loses her position and all that she worked hard to achieve, while her supporters and her own beloved fiancé abandon her. Enraged and hurt by this turn of events, Ersia swears to take revenge on those who turned their backs on her... starting with her former betrothed and his new fiancée."
