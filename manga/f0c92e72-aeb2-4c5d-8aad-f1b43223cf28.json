   "en": "*A work that was not collected in the Tezuka 400 released in 1978 due to Tezuka losing the originals, but collected in the Tezuka bunko.*\n\nMore-or-less a direct adaptation of the classic Walt Disney animated feature film of the same name.\n\n(from ebookjapan):\nIn the deep mountains of Australia, a life was born. The fawn, named Bambi, grows up together with the animals of the forest. One night in the forest, Bambi encounters a stag with magnificent antlers. As he follows it deep into the forest, he is surrounded by terrifying wolves....... \n\nA fantastic work by Osamu Tezuka, based on the Disney animated masterpiece!"
