   "en": "Setsuko Uchimura, who aspired to become a pediatrician, had graduated from medical school and passed the national examination, but she was undecided about what kind of doctor she would become after staying at the university hospital. Then, Daigoro Todoroki, the director of \"Kodomo no Oisha Toroki Kodomo Clinic,\" saw Setsuko treating children at the university hospital and asked her, \"Would you like to work at our hospital?\"\nSetsuko finds medical care at a university hospital involved in the latest medical technology and research exciting and rewarding, but she also feels that this may not be the place for her, so she immediately accepts Daigoro's invitation and sets out to work in a completely different environment, aiming to provide \"familiar medical care\" to children and their parents. \nIn a completely different environment, Setsuko struggles with children and their parents in an attempt to become \"familiar with medicine.\""
