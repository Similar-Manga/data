   "en": "Volume 1: Chintsubu A  \nPart 1 – Iwabuchi starts hanging out with girls from his cram school, and Kamiya-chinko freaks out. What is he up to?  \nPart 2 – Toride's soul moves up to Ayase's nipple.  \n  \nVolume 2: Chintsubu B  \nWhen Iwabuchi engages in more chinko cosplay, Kamiya is upset and they get into another fight. The cosplay chinkos are not to be missed in this!  \n  \nVolume 3: Chintsubu C  \nPart 1 – The chinkos are having a big discussion over what to do when they want to get off and their \"bodies\" don't.  \nPart 2 – Gives us the backstory on Iwabuchi's first impressions of Kamiya, when they first met long before the accident.   \n  \nVolume 4: Chintsubu D  \nKamiya injures his hand and can't engage in mutual jerking off with Iwabuchi, leading to a REALLY big fight.  \n  \nVolume 5: Chintsubu E  \nIt's summer and the chinko alliance head to the pool for some swimming fun, but can chinkos even swim?  \n  \nVolume 6: Chintsubu F  \nWhen Toride-chinko disappears one night, Ayase panics. The next morning, Hiro reveals that he has performed a successful remote exorcism on Toride-chinko, but when Toride-kun shows up at school with no memory of Ayase or the chinbi (chinko secret), Ayase tries to be optimistic about making Toride-kun fall for him all over again. What happened to Toride-chinko? Is he gone for good? Will Toride remember the chinbi and his feelings for Ayase?  \n  \nVolume 7: Chintsubu G  \nIn this installment of Chintsubu, Toride must come to terms with the fact that his chinko talks – and that it's fixated on Ayase. Ayase struggles to resurrect Toride's memories the only way he knows how: by working some hand magic on Toride-chinko. Unfortunately, he fails his mission and freaks Toride out in the process. Will Toride-kun be able to accept his wacky anatomy as anything other than a strange hallucination? Will he find the courage to talk to Ayase again, or will his fear of his over-excited appendage keep him down? This couple's drama gives Kamiya plenty of food for thought regarding his own relationship with Iwabuchi."
