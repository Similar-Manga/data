The International Secret Police, the Malayan Revolutionary Party, and an Arabian shadow organization enter into a three-way battle over the\ngolden capsule containing a sealed Japanese-German joint nuclear operation . Only the Black Prince can save humanity from the ever-approaching crisis of extinction!\n\n[Commentary]\nThe master's thrilling spy action, now in book form for the first time!\n\n\"Black Prince'' is a full-fledged spy epic drawn by Takashi Horie, a leading manga artist of the Showa era who has created numerous hit works such as \"Kennosuke Yaguruma'' and \"Tenma Tenpei.'' The story depicts the activities of a young boy who fights for peace by making full use of his clitoris-filled shoes, \"Air Shoes,\" and if you're a fan of Takashi Horie, you'll definitely recognize him here. yes. This is a work that follows in the footsteps of \"Hammer Kit,'' which was serialized in the monthly magazine \"Shonen'' in 1955 and later made into a movie. Furthermore, it can be said to be the classic Horie action movie, as it is the basis for \"Shonen Hurricane'' (now available in 2 volumes from Manga Shop), which was published in \"Bokura'' in 1966. It must be a work. And with the promised splendid action scenes and absurd storyline, it's sure to make enthusiasts grin."
