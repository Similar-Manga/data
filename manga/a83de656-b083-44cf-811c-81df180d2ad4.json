   "en": "I am having trouble because my child is weak in some physical education events in elementary school, such as \"I can't jump a jumping box'', \"I can't do a reverse jump'', ``I'm slow at running'', \"I can't swim''... I think there are many children as well. This book introduces how to overcome this problem through fun comics and carefully illustrated explanatory articles.\nThe author is a former member of Japan's women's rugby team and a professional sports instructor who has taught people of all ages how to stay healthy through exercise. This book is filled with know-how from actual teaching sites.\nIn physical education, there are tips and practice methods for each event. In addition to the above-mentioned events, this book includes more than 15 events such as popular ball games such as soccer, dodgeball, and basketball, as well as new events such as rhythm dance and tag rugby.\nIf you want to become good at physical education, start with this book."
