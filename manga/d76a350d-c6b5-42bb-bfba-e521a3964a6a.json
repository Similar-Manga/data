   "en": "**I'm done with romance, so send me home!**\n\nKim Yi-Young was just an ordinary civil service exam candidate in South Korea.\nAfter studying for more than four and a half years, she finally passed, a truly ordinary person with nothing but reading novels here and there as a hobby.\n\nHowever, on the day she went out for a celebratory meal after passing the exam, she got into a traffic accident and died, only to find herself reincarnated into the fantasy hunter novel she was reading.\n\nTo her, the \"System\" offered a way back home.\nDetermined solely to return home and cuddle her warm cat and adorable Maltese, Cerberus, she gained strength through dozens of regressions.\nSigning contracts with the constellations of the original work and dying multiple times, she eventually succeeded in conquering the \"Tower\" of the original work and defeating the owner of the tower on the final floor.\n\nNow, all that's left is to go home......\n\nOr so she thought!\n\n[Due to an error, instead of returning to the original world, we will reincarnate you into the author's new work!]\n\nI don't need that! All I wanted was my sweet home!\nIs that so difficult?! I even got rid of the Tower!?!?!\n\nMoreover, romance fantasy?! Even in my previous life, I didn't care about romance, not one bit!\nAnd to top it off, I didn't even reincarnate into my own body this time, but into the \"villainess\" of the book!\n\nI'm not afraid of the threats in this world, but I'm worried about being forced into a romance quest.\n\nCan I go home......?"
