   "en": "Odoro Town, which looks like an ordinary town at first glance, is a rare town where humans and ghosts can live together, thanks to the Mayor's Friendship Coexistence Plan. The main character, Kai, has a constitution that attracts ghosts, so he often gets entangled in ghosts, and he spends miserable days being helped by her classmate, Momoko and her mother, Iwako. If you go to a ramen shop, you'll be forced to eat ramen with the ghost's hair in it, and if you go to a family restaurant, you'll receive terrible customer service from the ghost staff and store manager, and you'll be almost eaten instead. I hated ghosts because I had a series of unfortunate days, such as being bullied by children from the first time I met them.\n\nOne day, her father-in-law, Ojinosuke, gets angry at the selfishness of Kai and the others and goes out. Without knowing that the biggest and worst crisis of Odoro Town would come that night."
