   "en": "Taikomochi refers to people who make a living by listening to the mood of their customers at drinking parties and making a living through comical speech and deeds and arts. Hanamichi Sakuraya, who works at the advertising agency Banpakudo, has the ultimate typhoon imprinted in his DNA for generations. He is also a new employee of the Trouble Consultant Group Special Reception Team, which aims to handle all kinds of entertainment and troubles within the company. Hanamichi is entrusted with dealing with troubles between Tetsuko Yamazaki, a beautiful copywriter who has a tough personality but is a badass, and her business partner. Solve your problems with the power of alcohol! I did, but maybe because of the alcohol, I lost my taga, and she decided to have sex with her at the hotel. A daily comedy manga about solving problems with the ultimate drummer's tricks (including slightly naughty means)!"
