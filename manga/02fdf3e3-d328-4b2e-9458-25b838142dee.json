   "en": "\"Tokaidochu Hizakurige'', which has spawned many imitation works as a typical humorous travel story, is a humorous book written by Ikku Jukkensha (Meiwa 2-Tenpo 2 [1765-1831 AD]), and its origin, consists of 18 books, from the first volume to the eighth volume. The first volume, ``Ukiyo Dochu Hizakurige,'' was published in 1802, and the upper, middle, and lower parts of the 8th volume were published in 1809, which is actually the latest to date. Published in 14). The Tokaido journey that begins with Tochimenya Yajirobei and Kitahachi, a former traveling actor, deciding to visit Ise Shrine, is filled with failures and humorous stories along the way, and the roads and customs of the city are also depicted. Ichiku himself had not planned on writing such a long story, but it was so well received that he continued to write 25 volumes, from the first volume to the 12th volume of Zoku Hiza Kurige, and the two of them moved to Edo. It will not be until 20 years later, in 1822, when the 12th edition was published."
