   "en": "During the Tensho era, the young boy Watari and the old man Ji took up residence in the ninja village of Iga, where the ninjas were divided into two rival factions, the Hyakuchi and the Fujibayashi Sects. The leaders of each sect ruled with the threat of death, and eventually those who wished to break the status quo formed a third Akame Sect. Watari and Ji play an active role in exposing dark conspiracies swirling around Iga Village, trying to overthrow the tyrannical ninja rulers."

One of the pioneers of the *gekiga* genre, he was well-known for his social critique and realistic drawing style.

Deeply influenced by marxism, the series touches upon the inherent discriminations that can be found in a feudal society and is a denounciation of the treatment of the *burakumin*, a Japanese social minority.\n\n*Kamui* ran until 1971, and was then restarted in 1988 in the magazine *Big Comic*, for which Sanpei had worked in the meantime.\n\nShirato Sanpei passed away on October 8th, 2021 due to aspiration pneumonia. His brother, Okamoto Tetsuji, who had worked with him as his assistant, passed away four days later of interstitial pneumonia."
