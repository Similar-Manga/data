   "en": "Part of the Myths and Legends Series, Shirato tackles the tale of Pentheus, as well as others of his bloodline, such as Europa and Cadmus.\n\nEuropa, daughter of the Phoenician King Agenor, is abducted by Zeus as part of a ploy to take down the Python. Cadmus, her brother, searches far and wide for her, and eventually reaches the literal ends of the earth. Fate has more in store, for him, however, as the interests of gods and men intertwine throughout his family, until it reaches his ill-fated grandson, Pentheus - who threatens to go against what his lineage has built up, and stood for.\n\nAlso includes Shirato's adaptation of the tale of Caeneus​, the woman who transformed into a man impervious to weapons, never to be raped again by another man."
