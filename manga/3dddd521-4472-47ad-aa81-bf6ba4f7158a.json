   "en": "I should be furious... So, why does it feel so good!? Ritsuka is a delinquent high-schooler who hasn't lost a fight in so long, he's forgotten what it feels like. But then, one day, Ritsuka picks a fight with a guy who calls himself a fan, leading to Ritsuka suffering his first loss in five years. Soon after, that same man, Shu, shows up at Ritsuka's school as a newly-transferred student and, for reasons unknown, wants to hide the fact that he beat Ritsuka from everyone. Wondering about his ulterior motives, Ritsuka calls Shu out behind the school building, but when he does Shu tells him \"I've always wanted to have you,\" wraps his hands around Ritsuka's waist, and pulls him close... After forcing a kiss from Ritsuka, Shu ties up his hands and has his way with him... and even though it's his first time having sex, Ritsuka ends up coming from anal...! An elusive transfer student and brawling delinquent virgin go head-to-head in this gay teen love story!"
