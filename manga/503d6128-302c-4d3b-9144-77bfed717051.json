   "en": "Gorgeous professional baseball manga featuring real baseball players.\n\nIn 1965, Arashitaro, a boy who grew up in an orphanage, appeared at the Tamagawa training ground of the Giants, and showed off his ability in pitching and hitting to Sadaharu Oh and manager Kawakami. Just when the scouts wanted to become a giant force, Arashi's rival Kosuke Kira threw a ball that hit him in the shoulder, leaving him unsure if he could succeed as a pitcher. Goro Tatsumaki, a habitual scout, plans to trick Arashi into joining the Giants' rival team, the Toei Flyers, by tricking him into joining the team. Deceived by this, Arashi signs his contract. Will Arashi be able to join his dream of joining the Giants? Or are you going to join the Toei Flyers as it is?\n\n(First appearance: \"Weekly Shonen King\", published on August 14, 1971)"
