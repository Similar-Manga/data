   "en": "In the midst of a female-kidnapping serial killer incident, Makoto's best friend Hinano has vanished completely. Desperate to find her before it's too late, Makoto will try anything– even invoking the resident phantom student of her middle school, Yotsuya-senpai!  \n  \nSurprisingly, Yotsuya-senpai appears to be an actual person. He's obsessed with creating the scariest stories ever, using the people and situations in Makoto's middle school to stage them. Though Yotsuya is mostly just interested making scary stories, Makoto finds that his stories tend to contain a kernel of truth and that they can reveal their terrible truth in the telling. But as Makoto helps Yotsuya stage his tales, can she convince him to tell the story of the whereabouts of her best friend?  \n  \n**Pilot Oneshot:** Kiben Gakuha, Yotsuya Sensei no Kaidan Oneshot  \nYotsuya-Sensei likes to tell stories, and his most recent one stems from the mysterious death near the school. Now the question is… was it a suicide or was it something more sinister?  \n  \n**Included one-shots:**  \nVolume 2: \"Asobiba.\"  \nVolume 3: \"Ou-sama Kid\" (King Kid), \"Kiben Gakuha, Yotsuya-sensei no Kaidan\" (Pilot)"

While the series was serializing, it was awarded the 61st Shogakukan Manga Award in the shōnen category and ranked in the top three manga series for the 2015 Sugoi Japan Award.

The series has also been given numerous adaptations, notably an anime television series and a stage play.\n\nIn the early stage of the serialization of Haikyu!!, in order not to make readers feel bored, Furudate  tried various storyboards, but the neighbor thought it was difficult to understand; later, Furudate  saw a passenger on the train reading \"JUMP\" and skipped Haikyu!!. Furudate was deeply affected, so he made up his mind to improve the storyboard and painting style to make it more concise and easy to understand.\n"
