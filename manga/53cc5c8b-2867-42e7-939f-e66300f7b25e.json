   "en": "Shuntaro Akagi works as an elite businessman at a general trading company in central Tokyo. He's been chosen as the personnel department head while still in his mid-thirties, and expects to soon marry his sweetheart, Asuka. Both his public and private lives seems picture perfect for continuing success... or so it seems. But quite by chance, this contented Shuntaro has to help out at Asuka's family business in the Tsukiji Fish Market, the well-known middle trader shop called \"Uotatsu\". However, the fish market is a place where competition is fiercely fought within the long-established conventions held by the expert traders. This total novice, Shuntaro, doesn't stand a chance against them. And of course he isn't a discerning judge of fish. The one and only thing he does have is an ability to distinguish good taste with his tongue. Shuntaro's days of fierce battle begin!!"
