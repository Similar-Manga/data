   "en": "\"My husband cheated on me? And the other party is that girl from......?\"\n\nMari Mizusawa, a housewife, lives with her husband Tatsuya and their son Umi. She lived a peaceful and happy life. However, one day Tatsuya started coming home late. Mari told herself, \"I miss him, but it's my job, so there's nothing I can do! Mari told herself, \"I miss him, but it's just work!\"\n But her feelings of vexation continued to grow. One day, she peeked at Tatsuya's phone and saw a large number of messages from cabaret girls!　\n\nSurprised but relieved by the sales e-mails, he saw a message.\n'If you don't love your wife, divorce her.' 'Glad to be her.' What the hell is this!　I scrolled down the screen, gasping for breath, and saw a message that said, \"I went to Mari's house today! I'm not sure if she's a cheater or not.\n\nJust because your husband cheated on you doesn't mean it happens for free!"
