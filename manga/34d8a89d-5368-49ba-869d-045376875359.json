   "en": "The Akizuki family, who run a small independent winery in Koshu , are at a loss. A casual visitor's gourmet critic praised the wine, which led to a flood of orders . The spirit of Gyoki , who continues to watch over the people , awakens the spirit that resides in the tree, preaches repayment, and accepts it, based on the history that the Akizuki family has protected the descendants of Koshu grapes related to Yakushi Nyorai for generations. Manifested.\n\nAround the same time, Takahide Tsuzuki, the president of Liber Inc., a comprehensive liquor manufacturer, also visited the Akizuki Winery for business negotiations. Takahide's daughter, Nanami, has become friends with the Akizuki family's Nanae, and Takahide continues to work on making wine with the Akizuki family, ignoring business negotiations.\n\nWhen the grape harvest season came, a rival manufacturer of Liber visited the Akizuki Winery for business negotiations. It was Takahide's ex-wife who left behind the newborn Nanami. Takahide, devastated by the wounds of her past, declares that she will never visit Akizuki Winery again. However, Nanami rebels and runs away from home. Lost in the darkness, Nanami nearly falls off a cliff, but is saved by the last of her powers. The nanami found by everyone who came looking for it was suspended by a thick grape vine, and in its hand was a grape seed left by Sei. Looking at the world from afar, Gyoki sheds tears at the innocence of the Grape Spirit who has completed his mission, and wishes for the lives of those who continue to live."
