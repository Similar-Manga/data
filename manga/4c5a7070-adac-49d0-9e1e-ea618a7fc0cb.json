   "en": "Isabelle is an orphan living in a temple with lots of knowledge about the love between men and women thanks to red covered novels that the saints had sneaked in.\n\nBut then, she found out that a priest secretly sold her to be a one-night stand for the duke who kills his lovers due to the shame of his inability to perform…\n\nThere’s only one way to get out of this, and it is to be a married woman.\n\nAt that moment, Isabelle recalled her childhood friend, Riggs, who said he wasn’t interested in dating.\n\n“So, Riggs, marry me.”\n\n“…What?”\n\n“Nobles would refuse unless it’s a pure woman.”\n\n“…Why do you hate the Duke of Cardiago so much?”\n\n“Everything else is fine. Being a tyrant? If you’ve lived your life to the fullest, that could happen. But there can be no problems at night.”\n\nRiggs was so frustrated that it seemed like he was going crazy.\n\nA few days later, the reclusive Duke of Cardiago came to the temple.\n\nOf course, the most surprising thing to Isabelle was the true identity of her childhood friend.\n\n“Isabelle, you wanted to get married. You can’t say no because you proposed first. I’m the closest man to your ideal type anyway.”\n\n“My ideal type?”\n\n“Don’t I know your ideal type? You like guys who are tall, handsome, smell of soap at night, and sleep in simple clothes. Also, on the first night, the bed should break.”\n\n“…”\n\n“That’s everything, and I can do it all for you. So marry me.”\n\nShe once knew everything about her childhood friend, but that changed the moment they got married.\n\n“Riggs, slow down…”\n\n“I think I’m slow enough.”\n\n“You weren’t always this impatient.”\n\nIsabelle said pleadingly, but Riggs replied with a smirk.\n\n“I was a childhood friend then, but now I’m your husband.”\n\n---\nIsabelle has always dreamed of meeting her true love and living happily ever after. Unfortunately, she discovers that she was just sold to the monstrous Duke Cardiego, who's infamous for killing his bride candidates. Her only way out is to quickly marry someone else, and as it turns out, her BFF, Lix, is the perfect choice! Although she tells him she will just stay a friend, Lix begins to show her that he doesn't feel the same way. Will their friendship be able to last through this matrimony?"
