   "en": "Even a popular announcer can’t win against a happy dad with his child. Nicknamed \"Prince\", he is the announcer of a morning program. Michiba was hiding his ambition with a smile, which was that 'I will be the most popular person from now on and laugh at people who ignored me in middle school'. Then he suddenly meets his first love, Sakaguchi! Sakaguchi is now divorced with a kid, but he didn't become weak when he saw Michiba. He instead complimented Michiba innocently by saying, \"You worked hard\" for a successful Michiba. Michiba is angry at Sakaguchi because he can't be arrogant around him, and his one sided love, which had been sealed before, is now on fire...?!"
