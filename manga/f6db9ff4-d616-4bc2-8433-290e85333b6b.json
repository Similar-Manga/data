   "en": "“Do you like me even now, Sou?” Hearing that revived painful memories from back then… In the train during college summer break, Sousuke reunites with Asafuna, a classmate from high school, with mixed feelings. This is because the day before graduating high school, they had parted in an awkward way when it was revealed that he had a crush on Asafuna. And, as if nothing had happened, Asafuna insists him to hang out with his usual smile. Even though he wanted to forget the sorrowful feelings, he can’t suppress his pounding heart when Asafuna embraces him… A clumsy love story of a direct, handsome college student and a college student afraid of love."
