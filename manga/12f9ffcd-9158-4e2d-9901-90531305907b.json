     "en": "**Name In Native Language:** 大友克洋\n\nOotomo Katsuhiro (born April 14, 1954) is a Japanese manga artist, screenwriter, animator, and film director. He, [Miyazaki Hayao](https://mangadex.org/author/6cdfb695-afc4-43af-bf76-20b2a4b37a7f), and [Mamoru Oshii](https://mangadex.org/author/1530ea1e-ba08-4dee-b2e6-a96b93849757) are together known as the “three giants of Japanese animation direction”.\n\nIn 1954, Otomo was born in Miyagi Prefecture. When he was young, he was deeply influenced by Tezuka's *Astro Boy* and *Jungle Emperor*, and determined to become a manga artist in middle school. In 1980, he began to serialize his famous work *Domu*, and in 1982, he began to serialize his most famous work *Akira*. In 1983, he began to participate in the production of animated films, and produced the animated film *Akira* based on his own manga in 1988, which achieved great success. Then his creative focus gradually shifted to animated films.\n\n“A boy with extraordinary abilities stands on the ruins of Tokyo, and everyone will say that this is Katsuhiro Otomo.”\n\\-Miyazaki Hayao\n"
