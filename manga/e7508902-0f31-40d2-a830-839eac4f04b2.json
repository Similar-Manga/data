   "en": "This book is for anyone who would like to get a good overview of linear algebra in a relatively short amount of time.   \nThose who will get the most out of The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra are:   \n- University students about to take linear algebra, or those who are already tak­ing the course and need a helping hand   \n- Students who have taken linear algebra in the past but still don't really under­stand what it's all about  \n- High school students who are aiming to enter a technical university   \n- Anyone else with a sense of humor and an interest in mathematics!   \n  \nThe book contains the following parts:   \nChapter 1: What Is Linear Algebra?   \nChapter 2: The Fundamentals   \nChapters 3 and 4: Matrices   \nChapters 5 and 6: Vectors   \nChapter 7: Linear Transformations   \nChapter 8: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors   \n  \nMost chapters are made up of a manga section and a text section. While skip­ping the text parts and reading only the manga will give you a quick overview of each subject, I recommend that you read both parts and then review each subject in more detail for maximal effect. This book is meant as a complement to other, more comprehensive literature, not as a substitute.   \nI would like to thank my publisher, Ohmsha, for giving me the opportunity to write this book, as well as Iroha Inoue, the book's illustrator. I would also like to express my gratitude towards re\\_akino, who created the scenario, and everyone at Trend Pro who made it possible for me to convert my manuscript into this manga. I also received plenty of good advice from Kazuyuki Hiraoka and Shizuka Hori. I thank you all."
