   "en": "One winter night, in a dormitory room, Wakana and Futaba were forced to wrap themselves up in a blanket as they continued studying because the heater had broken down. \"Weren’t you the one who had wanted to try having sex?\" Futaba just could not say no to the eager Wakana, and moreover, he felt so pleasurable when Wakana touched him… Nevertheless, embarrassment on his part caused him to flee from that room…  \nWas that a joke? Or was it just a case of curiosity? Futaba felt quite distressed because he did not know what was going through Wakana’s brain.  \nHow will this love relationship (which started off as a sexual one) turn out?  \n  \n4. Arabian Tenkousei (Arabian Transfer Student)  \nWhen a handsome Arabian transfer student mistakes fellow classmate, Futaba, for his missing lover, Futaba's world gets turned upside down as his maybe (?!) boyfriend, Wakana, and the stranger compete for his love. To make matters worse, the rivals look alike! What's a guy to do?"
