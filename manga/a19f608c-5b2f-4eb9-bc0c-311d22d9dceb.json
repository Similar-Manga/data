   "en": "Not many people know that Kenji Miyazawa, a poet and author of children's stories, was a teacher. This manga is based on a critical biography written by Sei Sato, who interviewed Kenji's students. This is a work depicting Mr. Kenji when he was in school (former Hienuki Agricultural School, now Hanamaki Agricultural High School). Kenji, who was looking down, was not there. Kenji, who was deeply cheerful and interacted with the students, appears. It will be a republication of the one published by Shogakukan in 2010 with new materials and supplementary corrections."
