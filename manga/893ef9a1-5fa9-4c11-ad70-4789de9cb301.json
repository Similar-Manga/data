   "en": "One night, a man with a mysterious trunk of gold comes to stay at a hotel. By the next morning, he has vanished, leaving behind his trunk. The man went by the name of Shunsuke Ohtori - but the name actually belonged to a reporter who had never went to that hotel. Shunsuke finds himself, along with some others, wrapped up in the mystery of the trunk. There are also several parties after the trunk for their own ulterior motives. Just who was that man, and what is inside the trunk?\n\n\nAn early gekiga work of Tezuka, serialized in a newspaper.\n\n---\n**Volume 58 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
