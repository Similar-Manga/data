They stalk and harass him, wanting to have lunch or (more to the point) sex. Because of this, Nanase relies on his cousin, Wataru, for protection against all the crazy stalkers, perverts, and freaks after his body. But in trying to gain Wataru's approval, Nanase seems to have lost him, and when he finds out the truth about Wataru, will he still avoid the intimacy of love?  \r\n  \r\n5) Amai Karada (Sweet Body)  \r\nEn has been with Ayumu-sama since he was a child, tempted with delicious cakes, and taking care of the disabled Ayumu-sama, heir to a great fortune.

Can Ayumu live without En's sweet body?  \r\n  \r\n6) Mika Tsuki no Kimi (You at the New Moon) extra - New Moon Gloom  \r\nKarou-sensei realizes that Teruya has gotten tall and strong, something that Teruya reminds him with with a quick flip. Accused of having lost his sweet \u0026 innocent charm, Teruya frets and wonders: did he lose all his appeal?"
