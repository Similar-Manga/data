   "en": "Isao, a boy who used to live with his father and sister, visits his father's hometown, Hokkaido, during winter vacation. Isao Hagi is told a cruel truth by his grandfather. My father, who is going to the United States, says that he sent us to Hokkaido to take them over. Shocked and indignant, Sao runs out of Grandpa's house saying she's going back to Tokyo, and has a fateful encounter with Gon the horse. Gon used to be a strong racehorse, but he became afraid of the race after falling over due to an inexperienced jockey in a horse race, and he stopped listening to people at all. Sao, who wants to see Gon, who has closed his heart, overlaps with her, tries to get him to recover, but he doesn't listen to what he says... One day, Isao is upset when he hears from Jiro, a boy who wants to become a jockey, that a horse that has stopped running will be used as meat. I will never let Gon do anything to meat! Perhaps Isao's feelings were understood, Gon tackles obstacles on the course with Isao on board! A story of the contact and growth of Isao, a boy who is fascinated by horses, and Gon, a racehorse, in the great outdoors!"
