   "en": "Joeji Inami, a native of Okinawa known as \"Joe Kaien,\" is a betting street fighter at a U.S. military base, and is usually a \"beater\" for 1,000 yen a shot. Joe was supposed to be the heir to the Ryukyu Karate Dojo, but after his sister was raped by an American soldier and committed suicide, he attacked a US military base, and his skills were recognized and he was invited to a street fight where he beat up an American soldier for money. I'm going to enjoy it. You can't understand someone's pain just by fighting. Through the \"beater\" who is silently beaten, Joe comes to feel the fear and pain of his opponent. In front of him, men who have forgotten all the pain in the hearts of others stand in his way in various ways! Street fighting action!"
