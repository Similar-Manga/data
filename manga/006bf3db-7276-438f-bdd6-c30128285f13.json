   "en": "Rena has been single her entire life. By day, she's a member of the general affairs department of a large corporation. By night, she's a bar hostess. One day, when Rena's having lunch with her friend Kyoko at work, Kyoko's brother and managing director, Shun decides to sit with them. Shun's popularity with the ladies at work is no surprise. He's the ideal gentleman, and his kind, charming personality even makes Rena begin to fall for him. But that evening, Rena's stunned to see that same man visit her bar. He even aggressively flirts with her, not realizing who she is. Talk about a 180! Realizing it's only a matter of time before she gets found out and loses her job, she resigns herself to her fate, downing glass after glass. When she wakes up the next morning, the first thing she sees is an undressed Shun sleeping beside her!"
