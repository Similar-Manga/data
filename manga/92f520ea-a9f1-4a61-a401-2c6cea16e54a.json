   "en": "world's first! A learning manga about the Emperor of Heisei is born!\n\nIn May 2019, the \"Emperor of Heisei\" abdicated and became the retired emperor. During the 30 years of the Heisei era, he traveled all over Japan, interacting with people, visiting disaster-stricken areas, and praying for the people.\n\nThe turbulent days of the \"Heisei Emperor\" have been reproduced as a realistic learning manga based on abundant historical materials. In his childhood, he was respected as the child of a living god, in his boyhood, when he was threatened by war, and in his youth, when he overcame many trials as the crown prince of a defeated country. 30 years of the Heisei era, where he has continued to explore and travel, and his determination to abdicate for the first time in about 200 years.\n\nKnowing the emperor of the Heisei era leads to understanding the two eras, \"Showa\" and \"Heisei\". From elementary school students to adults who love history, it is also recommended as an introductory book on modern history that can be read in one go!"
