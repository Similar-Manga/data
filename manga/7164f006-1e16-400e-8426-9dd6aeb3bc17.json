   "en": "Is he an eccentric or a hermit? Does the seemingly unremarkable company employee, Fujii, redefine the definition of \"happiness\"?\n\nIn the workplace, he's a plain middle-aged man who doesn't stand out. While he does his job properly, he's not one to waste words. Come quitting time, he disappears like a ghost. He's not the type to be invited to after-work drinks in the first place. More like, he's the guy who's thought of as \"I wouldn't want to end up like that...\" by his juniors.\n\nYet, he piques the curiosity of others... \"I wonder how he was raised?\", \"Does he have friends or a girlfriend?\", \"What does he do on weekends?\". Suddenly, you realize you've become captivated by Fujii... \n\nThis elusive emotion that's hard to put into words is vividly captured by the author of \"Reborn no Kishi\" in this bewitching life drama!"
