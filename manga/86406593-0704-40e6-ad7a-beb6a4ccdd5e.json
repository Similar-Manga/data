Learn - First book version!!\nIkki Kajiwara \u0026 Toshio Shoji are real swordsmen\nBetting their lives on the sword of “The Last Swordsman” Kenkichi Sakakibara Describe your life!!\n\nSynopsis\nKenkichi Sakakibara, who proclaims that ``swords are the art of killing people,'' meets Seiichiro Otani, the owner of a poor dojo.\nEven though he is repulsed by Otani, who treats any opponent as a draw, win or lose is a draw\nHowever, he gradually becomes fascinated by his “live human sword”――!?\u003c /span\u003e\nReprinted here!!\n\nCommentary\nThe sword is the road, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Champion in 1972, was written by Ikki Kajiwara and illustrated by Toshio Shoji. It is a period drama manga by. In 1969, this duo serialized ``Yuyake Bancho'', one of the masterpieces of manga author Ikki Kajiwara, in the same magazine. This work, which features many real swordsmen who were active from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period, including the main character Kenkichi Sakakibara, is in other words, the path of the sword. In other words, it is a work that pursues the \"heart.\" The sword is the heart, and along the way there is a gap between the ideal of the “living sword” and the reality of the “killing technique”, The sword technique that is lost with the passage of time. The sight of the main character struggling with the meaning of the book will leave an unexpectedly deep impression on those of us who live in modern society. This reprint is a [complete edition] that includes the entire story in a book for the first time. I want you to see the life of a swordsman who lives for the sword!!"
