   "en": "Ami Haruta (Airi Matsui), who broke off her engagement after being cheated on by her boyfriend, registers on a marriage activity app in desperation and discovers a post by Manatsu Miura (Mizuki Itagaki) saying that he is looking for a woman who will marry him on the same day. The two then decide to get \"immediately married\" without knowing anything about each other's faces, personalities, or backgrounds. Ami, who chose to get married out of desperation, thought that she didn't need love in marriage, just marriage---. They begin their newlywed life together, but Ami is attracted to Manatsu's kindness and manliness. The two quickly grew closer, but later discovered that they were both working for the same company! Unable to disclose their immediate marriage to those around them, they end up in a secret in-house romance. Then, Manatsu's colleague Kazuya Matsushita (Dash Wada), Ami's classmate Yuki Yamagata (Gaku Oshida), and massage therapist Kaimi Mochizuki (Toshiki Tateishi) begin to notice changes in the two...? \n\n(google translated)"
