   "en": "\"You have power, and you are dissatisfied with the world. Would you want to change the world… or would you rather change yourself?” — Akane Senri.\n\nThat was the beginning. A single choice that ultimately led to a global genocide, and a world where only two thousand humans survived...  by the very grace of those responsible.\n\nIn the eco-centric city of Kazamatsuri, a boy named Kotarou strives to assert himself in high school and attain an ordinary, peaceful life, but finds himself afflicted by odd phenomena within the city that seem supernatural. In his curiosity, he seeks out the rumored witch of the occult club, Akane Senri, and is inspired to join her club to prove the supernatural exists.\n\nUndeterred by her mysteriously probing questions and prickly nature, Kotarou brings life to the club and even recruits new members, forming a circle of friends in the process. But when they finally find proof, it becomes apparent that these strange events are symptoms of a dying world., and that his friends are hiding secret agendas fated to clash over this very subject.\n\nAfter the club collapses, Kotarou puts his trust in Akane and decides to serve as her shield to aid her work within \"Gaia\"-  a cult of environmentalist mages determined to preserve nature at any cost. As Kotarou's actions behind the scenes grow in proportion to Akane's influence and leadership within Gaia, the pair's emotions become increasingly entwined.\n\nYet, physiological changes brought by their occultic work and the weight of the roles they inhabit chip away at their sense of selves, causing them to reflect upon the blurriness of their own memories and question the history of their relationship. The two who love the other above all else may be destined for naught but tragedy, if they let it defeat them.\n\n[This is a canon-compliant fan book based on Akane’s Route in the original Rewrite visual novel and is written as a companion piece to the original story]"
