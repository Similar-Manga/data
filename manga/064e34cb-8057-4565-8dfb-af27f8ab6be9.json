   "en": "It seems that a new male teacher is coming to Iyana Elementary School's 5th grade! My name is Mitsuhiro Ayanokoji. Ayanokoji is the richest man in town. Mr. Mitsuhiro, the son of that family, is a cool gentleman who drives around in a convertible. I'm looking forward to this! The masculine girls' trio is excited about a teacher they haven't seen yet. However, what actually appeared was a man with bare feet and slippers and a stubble beard. Completely different from the image! ! A man with the same last name has come. In spite of the lamentations of the female students, he was named \"Dokadoka Dokkan-sensei\" because he walked around and shouted \"Dokkan\". As soon as he was new, he was noticed by his senior teacher who was noisy, but he himself is very self-paced. And after school, the girls who follow Dokkan sensei are bewildered when they see something unexpected... Volume 1 (2 volumes in total) of a powerful school comedy with a lot of laughter caused by a mysterious teacher full of vitality!!"
