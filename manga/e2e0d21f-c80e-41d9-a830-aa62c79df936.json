   "en": "Misaki and her ex-husband married for love. But it only lasted few years after Misaki collapsed and close to have a mental breakdown. In the eyes of her in laws, she failed as a wife and daughter in law; where was her husband when she needed his support most?….. Ryosuke spent most of his time and attention on his work. He thought his wife would appreciate his hard work; after-all, it was for the sake of supporting the family. But one day, his wife “suddenly”asked for a divorce… what went wrong? Kyoko was a housewife with low self-esteem. She was always physically and mentally bullied by her accountant husband, who would bring home his mistress even. Having been raised in a single-parent family, Kyoko thought she ought to stay put with her husband for the sake of her son…. but for how long before the last straw would eventually blow?"
