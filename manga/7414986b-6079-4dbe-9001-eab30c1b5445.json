   "en": "A child who lost everything to a villain. \nTen years later, that child returned as a hero called a demigod. \n\nAnd the enraged hero began his revenge by killing the villain and his family… \n\nBut there was a problem. \n\nIt was that Lila was the daughter of that villain. \n\n“Are you Lila Hildegar?” \n“You’ve got the wrong person.”\n“No, I think I’ve got the right one.” \n\n…Pretending to be someone else, failed! \n\n“Please spare me.”\n“No.” \n\n…Begging for her life also failed! \n\nThere was no other choice.\nLila chose the last resort. \n\n“Any last words?” \n\nIt was to swallow the “Regression Stone” and return to the past after death. \n\n“It wasn’t pleasant meeting you, so let’s never see each other again!”\n\nThat’s how Lila returned to the past, opened her eyes at the age of ten, and… \n\nDied again. \n\nLila tried to survive. \nShe tried and tried again.\nThat was all she did… \n\n“Why did you save me?”\n\nThe boy answered with a pale face.\n\n“Because I’ve gone mad.” \n\n…The enemy who had driven Lila to death several times became strange. \n\n[Villain’s daughter female lead/female lead who wants to live to be 90/is still the villain’s daughter even if she regresses]\n[Male lead who lost his home and family to the villain/male lead whose only goal in life is revenge]\n\n[Opposing parties are enemies → What are you doing right now…?]"
