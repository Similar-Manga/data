   "en": "Kitanokuni Elementary School in the deep snow uses the back of the gymnasium as a dojo, and the members of the kung fu club, including Kitakaze Kantaro, spend their days training hard. Daikoku-sensei, the advisor, is always sleeping and doesn't even give good guidance. Aiming at such Daikoku, a huge icicle falls off the roof of the gymnasium. It was the janitor grandfather who happened to be present who saved this crisis of catastrophic disaster. This old man who unleashed a series of jumping kicks and shattered icicles in the air was truly a kung fu master.\n\nThe club members were fascinated by the power of the technique and begged him to teach him. The members who left the club once, leaving Kantaro behind, couldn't stand the uncool appearance, but eventually all of them returned and struggled, and all five of them brilliantly cleared the three minutes. The days of full-scale training at the kung fu club, which welcomed her grandfather as her leader, began."
