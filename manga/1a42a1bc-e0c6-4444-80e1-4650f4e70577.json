   "en": "The Music of Marie is a fantasy epic of truly magnificent scale with gorgeous illustrations. In just two volumes, the author manages to create an incredibly rich and fascinating world that is full of wonders and enchanting beauties—a world in which men are watched over by the mechanical goddess, Marie, who, at times, appears in the sky. Her music brings hapiness and harmony to those who hear it. The main story centers around Kai, a young man who develops a deep affection for Marie and his quest for enlightenment."
