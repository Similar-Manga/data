   "en": "The great Demon Lord Dante, exploiting the weakness of a boy exposed to his demonic influence in his dreams, is awakened from a thousand-year sleep. The intent of this being, a survivor of an ancient and forgotten civilization, is to wipe out the whole human race.  \n  \nBut it's not that simple: the motivations of the demon aren't so wicked as one might think, and they will combine with the life of the boy, which hangs between nightmares and craziness. In the meanwhile, the Satanists fight against the hierarchy of the church to obtain a justice which is, as it's easy to guess, that of the Demon Lord.  \n  \nThis series is a complete remake of the original Demon Lord Dante, with new designs an a story slightly inspired by the anime of 2002. This time, the timespan of the story is longer, the character design is different, and all unanswered questions left when the original series was interrupted, are answered. This time, Demon Lord Dante has a proper ending."
