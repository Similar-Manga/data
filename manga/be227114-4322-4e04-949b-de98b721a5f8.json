She got out of the hospital in 2010, but she admitted in a statement that she wasn’t sure if she’ll ever return to manga work for health reasons. Nana’s last update came in 2013, where Yazawa made a two-page special for the 100th issue celebration of the manga’s magazine, Shojo Beat.\n\n(Source: Mangaupdates)"
