   "en": "(from amazon.jp)\n\nA collection of 12 short manga by Katsuhiro Otomo, created between 1976 and 1977 when he was 22 or 23 years old, in the order in which they were published. \n\nThe collection includes two stories from the \"GOOD WEATHER\" (1981) compilation and three stories including the title story from \"Highway Star\" (1979) published by Futabasha. \nAlthough stories were printed before, all of them are currently available only in this release, as the previously published editions containing them are all out of print. \n\nOf course, all of the works included in the book are based on the latest versions created from the original manuscripts, and the aged deteriorated parts have been repaired and printed on high quality paper. \n\nThis new edition is also larger in size than previous volumes, and the reading experience will be a vivid \"new encounter\" for readers, whether they have read the collected works or not. All colored pages are restored making it a complete edition!\n\n---\n**Volume 3 of the Katsuhiro Otomo Complete Works**"
