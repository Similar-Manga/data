   "en": "\"Master, please make me a man.\"\n\nYuma Hotaka has been changing schools all the time and has little connection with his friends. Not wanting to be forgotten after transferring schools, he came up with the idea of creating a strong character to live his school life.\nHe now plays the role of a popular guy who has girlfriends all over the place, and together with his prince-like appearance, he has succeeded in becoming a popular guy.\nIn reality, however, he is a pure-hearted boy who has never been in a relationship, let alone kissed anyone.\nThen, a real popular guy, Tadashi Someya, transfers to Hotaka's class!\nHotaka is impatient with Someya's attention-grabbing presence, but Someya begs him to teach him a technique to make the guy he likes fall in love with him.\nHe asks Hotaka to teach him some techniques to make the guy he likes fall for him. The contents of the lesson are all practical exercises such as kissing and licking his chest...?"
