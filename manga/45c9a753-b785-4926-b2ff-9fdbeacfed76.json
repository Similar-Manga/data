   "en": "Spring of 27 years old. The neighbor to whom she moves in is her natural enemy from high school, and --- her fiancé (tentative)! Yui has moved to a new neighborhood near her workplace when she becomes the manager of a lingerie store. \n\nWhile bracing herself for the new environment, she spends her days being soothed by the princes of Otome games, her only hobby. She has no experience in real-life romance, as she is not good with men due to an \"incident\" and the presence of a boy who is strict with only her. But she was fine with that. --But then she discovers that her neighbor in her new house is her former classmate, Sano Sosuke! Furthermore, his otaku hobby is exposed, and he is forced to pretend to be his fiancee for two months.\n\n Yui is frightened as she recalls Sano's cold and harsh comments in the past, but she is confused by Sano's blunt but somehow gentle and sweet eyes in front of her...?"
