   "en": "The comic version of the popular TV drama that\ncaptivated children in the 1950s along with \"Moonlight Mask\" and \"Kaiketsu Harimao\"\nis finally back in print!\n\nSynopsis\nThe main character, Molly, is a descendant of Genghis Khan.\nIf you collect Kublai's Arrow, a memento of his mother, Kinka's Bow of Orkon, and the evil monster Jaguar's Dattan's Body, you will be able to collect the enormous treasure that Genghis Khan left behind. You'll get a hidden treasure.\nMolly faces many dangers due to her possession of Kublai's Arrow.\nA mysterious old man, Chaya, helps him.\nAlthough they have a hostile relationship, Kinka gradually becomes attracted to Molly.\nAnd then there's the Jaguar gang, who set one despicable trap after another.\nHow will the fight over the treasure turn out?\n\nCommentary\nThe popular novel \"Leopard's Eyes\" by Makoto Takagaki was made into a television program on Radio Tokyo Television (currently TBS) in July 1959, and at the same time \na manga version (titled \"Jaguar's Eyes\") was published in Kodansha's \"Shonen Club\". '' \nwas serialized from the August 1959 issue to the July 1960 issue.\nMakoto Takagaki, known for works such as \"The Black Hood'', has released his first work, \"Ryujinmaru'', aimed at young readers, as well as serial adventure action novels such \nas \"Ginja no Cave'', and this is his third work. \"Leopard's Eyes'' was serialized in \"Shonen Club.''\nIt was serialized in the magazine from January to December 1927, and became extremely popular due to the gorgeous and profound illustrations by Hikozo Ito.\nTatsumi Katsumaru, who was in charge of the manga adaptation, is another name for Tenma Masato.\nTenma had already serialized \"Super Z'' (original work by Ichiro Miyagawa) in the same magazine, so he used a pen name.\nThe oily pen strokes of the brave boy Molly, the pretty beautiful girl Kinka, and the hateful yet unique villains are vibrant and vibrant, and it's clear that\nTenma, who has always loved the original work, enjoyed drawing them. You can tell.\nThe legendary manga \"Eye of the Jaguar'', which was published in two volumes in 1960, but remained unfinished since then, is now revived!"
