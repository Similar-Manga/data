   "en": "A super fantastic book that became Fujiko Fujio's starting point\n\nFujiko Fujio's first and last newly illustrated book published by Tsuru Shobo in 1953. Drawn under the name Fujio Ashizuka, he moved from Toyama to Tokyo and brought it to several publishers, but it was not accepted, and after being introduced by Osamu Tezuka, the company decided to make it into a book. However, because the cover was written by Noboru Oshiro and was published in conjunction with other manga artists' works, the two subsequent reprints had Fujiko draw a new cover and the coupling work was removed, leaving the book as original. It wasn't. This time, we have achieved a complete reprint that faithfully reproduces the text in two colors based on the original that Leiji Matsumoto had preserved.\nEarth was frozen by the ice bomb used by the S Federation during World War III. What the boy, who was confined in a shelter and revived 100 years later, sees is an Earth that has recovered from the damage caused by the ice bomb and has been rebuilt as a utopia with advanced scientific civilization. A masterpiece of apocalyptic science fiction that is still relevant today.\n\nThe first book and only newly illustrated work \"UTOPIA: The Last World War\" (1953) is finally available with two-color pages fully reproduced!\nAnd a must-have for fans, which combines all 26 works of the phantom first serial and manga artist's debut work \"Tenshi no Tama-chan\" (1951), whose total number was unknown for a long time, for the first time. Super commemorative volume!\nCommentary/Fujiko Fujio A."
