   "en": "A collection of rare masterpieces by masters rich in variety!\n\nMitsuteru Yokoyama, who made his spectacular debut with ``Soundless Sword`` published by Tokodo in Osaka in March 1955, was published as a separate supplement to Kobunsha's monthly magazine ``Shonen``. After publishing works such as Osamu Tezuka's ``Golden City``, he moved to Tokyo and began serializing in Kobunsha's ``Shoujo`` and other publications. From the June 1956 issue of Shonen, one of his masterpieces, ``Gigantor``, began serialization. It cements his status as a popular manga artist. For this project, we have selected Yokoyama's masterpieces from among the works he published in magazines from 1956 to 1957, focusing on works that have not been included in books. Included works are ``Kogarashi Daisuke``, ``Ranch Chorus``, ``Yuhime-sama and Yuki-chan``, ``Angel with Two Faces``, and ``The Man from Texas``."
