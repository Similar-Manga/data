   "en": "A collection of short stories.  \n  \n1) Love Dancing Beneath My Eyelids  \nCollege student Numakami has known for a long time that his classmate Mahara is in love with him. But Mahara is pure, innocent - and still a virgin. For some inexplicable reason, this makes Numakami feel annoyed at being the object of his affections.  \n  \n2) She's Missing  \nYanagi is in love with Kobayashi, who can't seem to stop talking about Adachi - a girl in their class. What will become of these three teenagers and their complex relationship?  \n  \n3) Minun Musiikki  \nA quiet pianist and an obnoxious, outspoken cellist often find themselves alone in the music room together…  \n  \n4) Yes It's Me, (5) Yes It's You, (8) Yes That's It  \nThe story revolves around Toma, who is head-over-heels in love…with himself! However, so is everyone else around him; and he knows that his business partner and old friend Enoki is no exception. Toma doesn't blame him – after all, he is only the most brilliant, beautiful, and all-around perfect person to ever walk the face of the Earth! Who wouldn't fall for him? Weirdly enough, Enoki is convinced that Toma returns his feelings. But they should both know by now that there's no one he loves more than himself…right!?  \n  \n6) Loathe!  \n\"I love you. And I know exactly what you love and what you hate. But regardless of how much I love you or how much time we spend in each other's company, there are things I loathe about you as well…\"  \n  \n7) Dreams Unfold at Night  \nA serious story about transsexuality and gender issues."
