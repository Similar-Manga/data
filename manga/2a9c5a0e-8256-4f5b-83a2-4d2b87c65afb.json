   "en": "In order to protect the peace of the universe, the alien Mach has arrived from Shiratori!! The Black Tyrant, an underground person who does evil things such as assassinating and brainwashing! Will the mysterious ally of justice, Mach, who has rushed to Earth all the way from the Cygnus constellation, defeat the underground people and restore peace to the earth!? The invincible hero action is back here!!- Commentary \"Uchujin Mach\", which started serialization in \"Shonen\" at the end of 1960, is a hero story drawn by Daiji Ichimine, the god of comicalization. The original author is Meiro Mune, who wrote the screenplay for the TV anime \"Shonen Jet\". Daiei Television was involved in the production, and it is believed that this work \"Uchujin Mach\" was also planned to be made into a TV work. While the main character of this work is an alien who protects the peace of the earth, the alien Mach's enemies are underground people, evil scientists, secret organizations aiming for world domination, etc. Only earthlings aim at the earth. The development of the story is interesting. The boy readers at the time must have been stunned by the diametrically opposite setting of an earthling hero who protects the earth from evil aliens!? [Complete version]. I want you to enjoy the activity of \"Superman\" \"Uchujin Mach\" straddling a motorcycle!!"
