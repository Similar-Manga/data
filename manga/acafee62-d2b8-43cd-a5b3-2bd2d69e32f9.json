Every time Satoshi starts to complain, Kakeru screws him until he can't stand up. But, with Satoshi's tendency to attempt suicide and his indifference to his own health, Kakeru finds that he can't leave him alone. Despite their growing bond, Kakeru won't admit that he's falling for Satoshi. Where will their romance take them…!? Behold the dangerous love between a host and a freaky stalker!"
