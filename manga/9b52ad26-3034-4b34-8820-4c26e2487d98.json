   "en": "In a little town near Osaka, an old tradition is being perpetuated. Every year, for hundreds of years, the men of the town defy each others in the \"grand ceremony of Masuraou\". Their weapons? Their courage and their fists! Their goals? Becoming the the king of the town!  \n  \nIt's in this atmosphere that Takeshi Yamato, a young high schooler from Tokyo, moves in. Ex-gang leader decorated with an incredible secret, he is decided to forget the past and become a socially acceptable guy… However, between his secret being found out, the fights, the girls and the messing up with his friends, he is far from becoming a model high schooler!  \n(Source: MU)  \n  \n [Official French](https://www.amazon.co.uk/N%C3%A9s-pour-cogner-Shinichi-Sakamoto/dp/2756014761)   \n [Official Chinese](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010398056)"
