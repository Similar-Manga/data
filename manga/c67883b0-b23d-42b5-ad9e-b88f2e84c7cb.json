He also suggested that she moves in with him for a while! He is the complete opposite of the cool guy at work, and his sweet attitude makes her nervous....why is he being so nice to her? Fukase-kun seems to have a secret...? \nA very sweet and tender love story of a man who loves too much and a girl who is not very good at being sweet!"
