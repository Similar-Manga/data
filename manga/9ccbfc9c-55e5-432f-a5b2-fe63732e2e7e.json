   "en": "Boxer Janado has broken his left fist four times due to the destructive power of his punches. However, despite being away from the game for two years, he still hasn't given up on his quest to become a champion. He serves as a sparring partner for Kano, who is preparing for a world championship, and knocks him out with one punch. The gym president, delighted that his left fist had been revived, organized a comeback match for Janado. Jinado KOs his opponent with a right punch, but it turns out that he can't hit his left punch with the thin gloves he wears for fear of breaking a bone. Even so, Janado continued to win, and was scheduled to fight against Kiev for the number one spot in Japan's lightweight division. Janado instinctively follows Kiev's speed, which cannot be seen by the ordinary eye. Kiev's fighting instincts awakened, and from the start of the 3rd round, the battle continued with both players taking no breath!"
