   "en": "(from [TezukaOsamu.net](https://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/105.html) )\n\n\"Tuberculosis\" depicts the adventures of Kenichi and his uncle, Mr. Mustachio, inside a boy's body. After being injected with a drug called ZX that was discovered by Mustachio, Kenichi and his uncle have shrunk and become very small. \n\nWhen they enter the body of a boy and reach his lung, they find that tubercle bacilli (bacteria) are opening a big hole in the boy's lung. Tubercle bacilli send Mode (a tubercle bacillus), a daughter of Dr. Iyoa (also a tubercle bacillus), to Kenichi and Mustachio to learn the human language. \n\nThe two make friends with Mode, but a war breaks out between the tubercle bacilli and the commandos in the boy's brain, and the two become involved in the war.\n\nPublished as a tankoban, Tuberculose is an early work of Tezuka's that has not been collected in any edition of the complete works, nor reprinted along with others in the Fukkan [*Early Masterpiece Selection*](https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68319967) boxsets. \n\nA second attempt at the work was done by Tezuka in the form of [*Monsters on the 38th Parallel*](https://mangadex.org/title/62d34aff-ca8d-4dc7-8419-4b3702104461/monsters-on-the-38th-parallel)."
