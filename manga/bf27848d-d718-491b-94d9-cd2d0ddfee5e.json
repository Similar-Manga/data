   "en": "Kikuchiyo, the older brother, and Damon, the younger brother, who work at the Health Department of the Funkoroga City Public Health Center. Due to rent delinquency, the landlord's old lady also eats her monthly salary. A life-sized cockroach \"Gokkii\" who rolled into the Bimbo boarding house where such two people live. An insect gag that has completely settled in nature and travels all over the world as a trio. Sometimes I exterminate demons, sometimes I meet someone, sometimes I work for a yakuza, sometimes I work part-time at a sushi restaurant, and sometimes I help with a bank robbery. Can't you find something delicious, or is there a way to make good money? Even if you don't have anything, you can manage if you live brightly. Very human? Gokkii is a mess. At the end of the book, \"Super Chinese (2) Dragon Kids\" is included, in which two boys, Sparrow and Dragon, play an active role in saving the Chinese land that has been taken over by the demon army. \"Gokkii Color Pinup\" appendix at the end of the book."
