   "en": "Watanabe Futatsuki is a chef at the student restaurant for a local high school. He specializes in ramen, delicious food made from humble ingredients. Futatsuki believes that two kinds of enjoyment come from cooking food-- the enjoyment of the customer, and the enjoyment of the chef in seeing his customer's happiness.\n\nOne day, new people take over the high school, with plans of changing it from a third tier school to a top-tier one. Their plan involves drastically altering the nature of instruction and the environment of the school, and it includes the closure of the school restaurant where Futatsuki cooks. In its place, the arrogant Azumi Hinano will open a first-class restaurant, and she wastes no time in seducing the students to her side with delicious high-class food. Futatsuki despises her dismissive attitude toward ramen and her view of the students as slaves to be ruled. Will Futatsuki have the skill and support to be able to take a stand for the continued existence of the old student restaurant?"
