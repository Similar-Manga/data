   "en": "*Published as a tankobon, Tezuka's Golden Bat has not been collected in any edition of the complete works. There were several reprints even as recent as 1980, but there are no current means of being able to purchase the work outside of sites such as Mandarake.*\n\n(from [ogonbatter.web](http://ogonbatter.web.fc2.com/tezuka.html)):\n\n**\"It's the new King who's at fault. So, everyone\nI want you all to sacrifice for the sake of Justice.\"**\n\nAn innkeeper in the deep snowy mountains receives an unusual visitor. Wearing a hat and a coat, he becomes excited when he hears that Golden Bat, a thief who lurks in town, is after the \"Ruby Diamond,\" a jewel belonging to the Duke of Sarada. The policeman, suspecting that it might be the Golden Bat himself in disguise, takes away his hat, but the face that should be there is missing. The mystery guest is the invisible woman.\n\n　What exactly is a Ruby Diamond? The Duke of Sarada tells his son, Tommy, about the strange fate of this gemstone.\n　Originally, the Ruby Diamond was a treasure of the Corona royal family on the tropical  Ruby Island, and shone brilliantly on the crown as a sign of kingship. Ruby Island was a peaceful land, but one day, Minister Puky and the Physician Fuxquii plotted a rebellion and poisoned the King of Corona.\n　Princess Cocoa, forced to become Fuxquii's queen in exchange for the king's life, attempts to resist, but steps on a landmine set by the villains and dies an untimely death.\n　As her soul was taken up to heaven, God spoke softly to her, **\"Let us go to Earth, I will let you return one more time.\"**\n　Princess Cocoa's soul returned to earth to retrieve the stolen Ruby Diamond and destroy the rebels. However, since she had lost her body, she could not be seen or heard by others. She can hardly interfere in the affairs of this world.\n　As the years passed, rumors continued to circulate that the ghost of Princess Cocoa still haunted the cursed Ruby Diamond.\n\nIt is not only ghosts that haunt the Ruby Diamond that have come into the hands of the Duke of Sarada. The eyes of the Golden Bat, a thief who claims to be a descendant of Minister Puky, are shining.\n Golden Bat successfully escapes with the diamonds after raiding the Duke's mansion, but is intercepted by an invisible person.\nThe Duke of Sarada sees that it is the ghost of the princess, and gives her clothes and a mask to make her look exactly like she did before her death. He then took out the real Ruby Diamond that he had hidden in his possession. What Golden Bat had taken from him was a fake.\n　\nAt that time, Tommy followed Golden Bat to Countess Grasshopper's abode.\n　The Countess tricks Tommy into drinking a paralyzing poison. She is the true identity of the Phantom Thief Golden Bat, and her servants are in actuality Golden Bat's henchmen. When the Countess Golden Bat discovers that the Ruby Diamond is a fake, she uses Tommy as a hostage to force the Duke to hand over the Ruby Diamond to her. The Duke is forced to hand over the Ruby Diamond to Golden Bat's henchman, but the invisible Princess Cocoa secretly chases after the henchman as he is being pulled away.\n　Princess Cocoa overhears a conversation between Golden Bat and the mad scientist Dr. Tin-Tin at the Countess' mansion. The princess seizes the opportunity to retrieve the Ruby Diamond and attempts to break Tommy out of her prison. However, without the clothing of this world, her voice does not reach Tommy. After a misunderstanding, Tommy swallows the Ruby Diamond, and the Golden Bat gang thinks of transporting him to Ruby Island to dissect him.\n\nThe Duke of Sarada and Princess Cocoa board a cruise ship bound for Ruby Island in order to stop Golden Bat. The Princess says that Countess Grasshopper is Golden Bat, but the Duke of Sarada cannot believe it. When a gust of wind causes Tommy to fall overboard from her trunk, the Duke is finally convinced of the identity of Golden Bat, and he runs all over the ship, exchanging gunfire with her.\n　Then the wind played another trick. A waterspout hit the cruise ship, rolling up the seawater, and all the crew and passengers were blown away elsewhere..."
