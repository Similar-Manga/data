   "en": "Since its debut in 1978, Cat Cross Society has challenged all genres of manga and devised various methods of expression.\nAnd the works that came to fruition were incredibly kind, big, sad, and fun, unfolding a creative world unique to Cat Cross Society.\n\"Small Tea Party\", \"Kuro no Monmon Gumi\", \"Phantom Beast Country\"... Even just the long-running serial works are diverse, such as fairy tales, gags, and fantasy, and each of the works written in between , each of which is unique.\nThis collection of works is a collection of masterpieces that gives a glimpse of the trajectory of Cat Cross Society's works, which have such a variety of faces, mainly short works.\n\"Woman of the Jewel\" is a unique work of aesthetics that borrows the form of non-fiction, set in the overripe Paris of the early 19th century.\n\"Hibi no Bubbles\" is a gem that uses fantastic motifs to lightly draw various thoughts that arise from everyday life and sublimate them emotionally.\n\"Venus Chair\" is a love story that touches the heart of a woman who suddenly finds herself returning to herself.\nAnd \"Shishi no Iru Sato\" and \"Suisui Houroki\" are the ultimate fantasy works.\nInspired by folk mythology, this work will make you feel comfortable and intoxicated with the calm and limitless salvation from the other side of life and death.\nHere time as we know it stops and a world of dreams emerges.\nEach work is colorful, and the underlying theme is the joy and pain of living.\nThis earnest thought is depicted lightly, happily, and painfully."
