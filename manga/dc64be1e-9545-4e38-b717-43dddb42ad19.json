   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nThe father, Donnoshin, is an energetic man. His son is Dontaro. The Katsu family has no mother, but they live together happily. Their next-door neighbors are the Ajino family of Misozo, who are always tired. Donnoshin is a medical doctor and runs a clinic, although his physiognomy makes it hard to believe. But since a large hospital was built nearby, the number of patients has been decreasing. On top of that, he is a good-natured fellow who repairs broken dolls and televisions for free. That's why Dontaro's allowance is so small ......!　A humanistic comedy!"

In the 1970s, Ishimori created metamorphosis manga such as Kamen Rider and in the 1980s, he became a pioneer of a new manga category.
