   "en": "The main character, Yu Shinozaki, is an honor student in her second year of high school. However, something has been bothering him recently. What does he want to do? Who am he? He seems to be in a rebellious phase, but he is a far-sighted person who feels that such questions are ridiculous. Eventually, he begins to shut himself in his room , and just when you think it's been a long time since he went to school, he ends up submitting his exam answers for all subjects blank. There is a large transparent clock on top of the school building he attends. The clock casts a shadow, and the students learn the time from the shadow and act according to that time.\n\n\"I don't like something...I don't like clockwise rotation like everyone else...\"\n\nIn order to escape from this monotonous life, Yuu sets out on a journey on a Yamaha Sero 225 , a motorcycle that was suddenly bought on a whim and left abandoned. This was the first time he tried turning counterclockwise."
