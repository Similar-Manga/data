Bontenmaru hears about the one-eyed dragon from the monk who stopped it, and decides to live as a being that surpasses humans. And Masamune, who succeeded him as head of the family, aims to conquer Oshu in order to take over the country...!?"

Meant to be a group to help him with his works, as a consequence Harenchi Gakuen, where he derived almost no royalties from the TV series, films, or related merchandise, Dynamic Productions became a company established to manage Nagai's relations and contractual rights of his work. Dynamic became one of the first companies to require publishers sign contracts (even today many manga are created and published only on the basis of verbal agreements).\n\n(Source: Wiki)"
