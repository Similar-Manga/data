   "en": "This work, which has been serialized in ``Boken Ou'' since 1977, incorporates elements of aircraft comics into boy action. It is a work. The author is Gosaku Sakurata, who had a wide range of serials from girls' comics to graphic novels at the time. Since the mid-1970s, as a member of Dynamic Pro, he has been in charge of comicalization of numerous robot animations such as \"Mazinger Z\", \"Great Mazinger\", and \"UFO Robo Grendizer\". In the work, Mach Squad, which freely controls cool jet planes and follows strict orders that do not seem to be \"friends of justice\" under the name of \"for peace\". The ability to draw such anguish with a pen touch that touches the heart is cultivated through his rich writing history. In addition, in this publication, the final episode and other unpublished episodes will be recorded for the first time."
