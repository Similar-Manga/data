   "en": "\"When we met, I fell in love with you…\"  \n  \nThe novelist Sakaguchi was troubled. When Sakaguchi took in a weak kitten, the high schooler Kazuya, who comes to his house to visit the cat, suddenly confessed. He thought it was just childish nonsense, but while usually being quiet, the Kazuya who awkwardly confessed his love seemed cute to Sakaguchi. But… adult love also entails sex, right?"
