   "en": "In the summer of 2003, the author, Hitoshi Kurosaki, sold his household goods, gave up everything, and began crawling around Shikoku's pilgrimage routes on his bicycle as a \"restructured manga artist''. After returning to Tokyo, He had a chance to draw \"55 Year Old Map'' as a travel manga. Six years later, in the summer of 2009, Kurosaki, who had reached his 60th birthday, was about to board the ferry at Tokyo's Ariake Terminal on his bicycle. The destination is, of course, Shikoku! Eventually, Kurosaki reunites with Isshin and the friends he met on his travels, who he also drew in \"55-year-old map'', but... a shocking\nfact awaits him!! *This book is an e-book version of the names (rough sketches) that\nthe author drew in his \"Japonica study book (free book)\" as a picture diary."
