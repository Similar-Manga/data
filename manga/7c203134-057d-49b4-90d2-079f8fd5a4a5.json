   "en": "(from ebookjapan)\n\nLate 19th century London: a 10-year-old girl, Crystal \"Christie\" Margaret Hope, happens to be the famous detective Sherlock Holmes's niece. \nArmed with the deductive powers inherited from Holmes and a voracious curiosity, Christie takes on a variety of difficult cases. \n\nOne day, someone sneaks into Whitehall and steals expensive jewelry. After overhearing an outline of the case by chance, she deduces \nin just three minutes what Holmes' partner Watson took three hours to find out and then confronts the culprit directly...!\n\n**Curator Note**\nWhile first volumes arcs and chapters are direct adaptations from Conan Doyle's novels and short stories\nlast two volumes are original Shintani scripts taking some inspiration from titles or Watson/Doyle's hints \nto unpublished tales, The Giant Rat of Sumatra being the most well-known example"

In addition to his very popular pilot comics, Shintani has successfully ventured into science fiction, fantasy, comedy, and hentai comics as well. In 1985, he was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen for Area 88 and Futari Daka.\n\nHe was an assistant to [Shinohara Tooru](https://mangadex.org/author/3221c004-d111-4481-a46b-8248dd157bb3/shinohara-tooru) during his high school years.
