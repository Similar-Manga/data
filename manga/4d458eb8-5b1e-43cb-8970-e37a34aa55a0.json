   "en": "May 2003. An icy planet from distant space crashes into Venus, changing its qualities completely. These qualities prove to present some habitability for humans, enticing men to eventually colonize it for themselves...\n\n80 years later, Venus is home to many people who call it home. However, an ever-present tension between the two major continents, Aphrodia and Ishtar, points to an ominous fate for Venus.\n\nHiroki Senoo is a rather rebellious member of a motorsport popular within Aphrodia's capital. One day, members of Aphrodia's military approach Hiroki, and, impressed by his skills, invite him to join. Thus, Hiroki finds himself enveloped in Venus's political landscape...\n\nNote: Chapter count resets with Volume 3 to correspond with the second part."
