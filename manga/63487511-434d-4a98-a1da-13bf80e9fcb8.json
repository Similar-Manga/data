   "en": "*Tezuka completely redrew this from memory for the Tezuka 400 when this version was presumed lost. \nIt was later rediscovered and collected in the Tezuka bunko.*\n\nThe young Pete jumps aboard a ship captained by a friend of his late father. With a treasure map he left behind in his hands, he and the captain embark on an adventure to hunt it down. However, pesky pirates - like Bowarl and his crew - get in the way, also seeking the treasure for themselves! What sort of island is Treasure Island? And who will get the treasure first?\n\nSakai is credited for the 'story' of this edition due to the many cuts and alterations he made, including the ending of the manga. Tezuka was not pleased with his edits, and did not consider it a work he did by himself. When collected in the Complete Works, the original was presumed lost, so Tezuka redrew the whole work from memory, restoring the cuts (such as Peter Pan). This edition is more of a 2/3koma compared to the 1984 definitive edition, which is a 4Koma."
