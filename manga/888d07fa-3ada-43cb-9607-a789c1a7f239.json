   "en": "Jotaro Fukamachi is a private detective. He is divorced from a woman he can't forget, with whom he had a daughter. He is allowed to see her once a month and has regular telephone contact with her. He lives in the office of a strong-willed woman dentist (who becomes his partner at the end of the series). He has a reputation as a sleuth, but he's rather stingy and often self-serving. On the other hand, he has principles (sometimes rather caricatured) that he sticks to. The most important of which is to \"always keep a promise\", even if the person to whom he made it is no longer with us. As a result, he sometimes invests excessively in businesses that bring him no profit. He is friends with a rather nerdy and gentlemanly Yakuza leader, Kurosaki, has connections with a gun-runner called \"the fugu\", a dirty police commissioner and other local residents. Through cases of disappearance, local investigations and searches for missing persons, he comes face to face with the darker side of human nature. But he never loses his sense of humor or his faith in humanity."
