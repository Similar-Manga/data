   "en": "Kina is one of a group of four boys and girls who have been good friends since school. She has feelings for Tsukasa, a member of the group, but has kept her love secret because of her best friend Rui, who is also dating Tsukasa. However, when Tsukasa and Rui report their marriage, she feels hurt by her feelings, which she should have put away, and she is disgusted with herself for not being able to sort out her feelings properly. In the meantime, she has a meeting with Tsukasa's best friend, Yutaro, to help with Tsukasa and Rui's wedding. While talking there, she receives an unexpected proposal from Yutaro.\n\nThis is a love story that begins with a lie, which sadly sprouts in the wakes of the story."
