   "en": "This is a compilation of 15 manga one-shots written and illustrated by Katsuhiro Otomo between 1974 and 1976, when he was in his early 20s.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-\"ONE DOWN\" and \"Kagami Jigoku,\" -\nmanga adaptations of short stories by Rampo Edogawa , both of which were previously uncollected, and the long-awaited first collection of two of them.\n\n-\"There is a Voice Calling You Awake\" - \nhas a fantastic last page, which was omitted from both the publication and the book, and this is the first time it has been shown in this book.\n\n-BOOGIE WOOGIE WALTZ\" and \"GOOD WEATHER,\"-\nboth published by Kitansha, were distributed almost exclusively by mail order at the time and were rarely seen in bookstores, making them difficult to obtain for a long time.\n\n---\n**Volume 2 of the Katsuhiro Otomo Complete Works**"
