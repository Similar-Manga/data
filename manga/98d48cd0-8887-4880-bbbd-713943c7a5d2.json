   "en": "Nagai's ecchi parody of Star Wars with one of the leads being a genderbent barely covered parody of Luke Skywalker named Ryuko Skywalker.\n\nIt's regarded as Nagai's second attempt at Shameless School and was very controversial with the Parent Teacher Association of Japan from the very first chapter. \n\nIt includes much suggestive and violent content, leading to it only lasting a year in serialization. \n\nMost physical copies of the work are out of print, but can be acquired from sites such as ebookjapan with ease.\n\nThe work debuted around the same time as Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura."
