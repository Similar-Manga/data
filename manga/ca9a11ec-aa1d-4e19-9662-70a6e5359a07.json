   "en": "A manga essay drawn by Taro Minamoto from the historical masterpiece series \"Fuunjitachi\" is republished for the first time in 10 years!! In the 1950s, when Japanese movies were still active, Minamoto's own experience as an extra in Kyoto and Uzumasa. Episodes such as encounters with actors are told while incorporating historical considerations! The title story, ``Challengers,'' and the hidden episodes of Izo Okada, who served as a bodyguard for Kaishu Katsu and John Manjiro, were very popular among history buffs. In addition to works such as \"Nihon Kenkaden\", this is an expanded and revised edition that also includes works not included in the book \"Yataroden\" and \"Chitdan Shinsengumi Moeyo Ken\"!!\n\nContains 12 autobiographical comic essays on topics such as ``Traveling Westerns,'' ``Kyoto and the end of the Edo period,'' and ``gamer and chivalry,'' as well as his experience playing a role in a historical drama at the Kyoto Uzumasa Film Studio.\nMinamoto Taro's youth story serialized in \"Zanki\" magazine and others from 2000 to 2002!"
