   "en": "Manga is for children!\nA masterpiece that 100% reflects Tera's view of manga, the first complete edition!\n*Recorded at the end of the book*\nInterview with Jun Kajii, author of \"The Age of Tokiwaso: Hiroo Terada's Manga Path\"\n\n[Synopsis]\nZero-kun, a member of the Shiinoki Town youth baseball team \"Z Team,'' was the strikeout king who was always an alternate, but through his dedicated efforts he won the position of regular center fielder and number one batter. Zero-kun suddenly became a popular player, but he joins the team not only in baseball but also in various incidents and problems that occur in the town, along with his kind-hearted younger sister Kimiko-chan who cares for his brother, and the reliable captain Oyama-kun, who adores Zero-kun. Gon-chan will do his best to fight with his good advisors, Nonki-sensei and others!\n\n[Commentary]\nHiroo Terada was loved by the nickname \"Terra-san\" at Tokiwaso, a sacred place for manga artists. The first masterpieces that come to mind are \"Sportsman Kintaro'' and this work \"Uniform Number 0''. Both are masterpieces that put the readers (children) first. In contrast to \"Supokin,'' which has a glamorous setting in which characters from fairy tales play great roles in professional baseball, \"Uniform Number 0'' features a baseball boy, \"Zero-kun,'' who can be found anywhere, as the main character, and tells the story of his family, friends, and family. This is a daily life manga depicting everyday life at school and in the town. Tera probably thought that there was something that could be conveyed because the protagonist was a familiar character who sometimes made mistakes and failed. The freshness of sportsmanship and the importance of friendship conveyed by Zero-kun and his friends became popular, and the series was serialized in Houbunsha's \"Baseball Shonen'' for five years. After the magazine discontinued publication, the serialization continued with changes in magazines such as \"Shonen Sunday'' → \"School Magazine'' → \"Boys Life.'' This book is the first complete edition that includes all the serializations of \"Baseball Boy'', which can be said to be\nthe origin of the work. Please enjoy this masterpiece that 100% reflects Tera's view\nof manga. You should be able to remember how you felt when you were a baseball player."
