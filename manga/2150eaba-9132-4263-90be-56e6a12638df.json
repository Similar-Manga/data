   "en": "Defeating the evil and helping the weak! The definitive version of the historical manga in which the samurai boy Shintaro is active is now available as a book for the first time !! Also includes the short story ``Daabare!! Little Samurai''!\n\nSynopsis\nShintaro, a young swordsman, abandons his hometown and comes to Edo with his father.\nHe has the personality of ``I can't forgive a mistake!'' and confronts the domineering students of the dojo and a gang of thieves causing trouble in the city!\n\nCommentary\nThe first book version of ``Samurai no Hymn'', which has been serialized in Kodansha's ``Bokura'' since 1966! The story of Shintaro, who has a strong competitive spirit but cannot overlook those in trouble, confronts evil people in order to save his friends and father.\nDrawn by the familiar Hisashi Sekiya.\nThis work is not just about Shintaro punishing bad guys.\nWhile Gounosuke, the main character of ``The Wonderful Samurai,'' is a hero-like hero, Shintaro is a larger-than-life character who cannot be called a hero . It would be interesting to compare the two. This time, the short period manga ``Daibabare!! Chibikko Samurai'' was also included.\n\nPlease look forward to the success of the samurai boys!"
