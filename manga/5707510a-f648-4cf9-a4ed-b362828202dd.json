   "en": "Kiritaro, a young samurai born in the Warring States period, was searching for his mother. In the midst of his search, he met Kasumi, a young ninja of the Kouga school of ninjutsu. He spent a few happy days with Kasumi and her grandfather, Kasumi Hakuun, who was also a ninja master, before continuing on his journey. After Kiritaro left, Hakuun was killed by Shin Higashihara. Kasumi, now an orphan, was reunited with Kiritaro and set out together to find revenge for her grandfather.\n\nThis book is the author's memorable debut work, published by Tomoe Publishing in 1957. It is not only the starting point of his career as a manga artist, which began after working on picture books, but is also a notable work in manga history, as an origin of the Ninja Bugeicho and Kamuiden genres."
