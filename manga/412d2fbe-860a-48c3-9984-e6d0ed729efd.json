   "en": "Daichi Yukiyama, a boy who came to Tokyo from Hokkaido because he was fascinated by boxing! Although he has a self-paced personality like a cow, he joined Morisaki Gym while making a living as a milk delivery worker. Training hard to become a champion! Passionate boxing manga! ≪Natsuki Owada's first serialized work \"Toughness Daichi'' had a modest start. According to him, \"The first time around, I was at the bottom in terms of popularity.'' Six months later, it was in the top three, and a year later, it had become one of Shonen Magazine's signature manga. I was a fan too, so I was very conscious of it. The author's straightforward style is sure to be well received by today's readers. In the work, a character named ``Turkish Kobayashi'', who has a shaved head, narrow eyes, and a beard, appears as the main rival of the main character, Daichi. Turkey, of course, has nothing to do with the Republic of Turkey. Young people probably don't know this, but the so-called \"Turkey\" of those days was a popular and friendly place for working men, a \"friend of the soul\" and a \"source of vitality for tomorrow\", a place of healing. It was. Please read this while supporting Tokko Kobayashi. (Makoto Kobayashi)≫"
