   "en": "Born in 1987, the sports \"Cycle Buggy\" is an advanced form of battlecross BMX and cross-country. Compete in the mountains and fields with three-wheeled bicycles. The main character, Susumu Ikuzawa, was enjoying his cycle buggy with his friends, but one day he jumped into the roadway and caused a collision with a taxi. One of the passengers, Senonaka Narukane, is the chairman of the Cycle Buggy Association, and he lent me 1 million yen to repair the accident. The repayment is said to be returned with the prize money of the \"Battle Cross Jigokudani Survival Race\" hosted by himself. Susumu Ikuzawa wins the championship and pays off his debts, despite the interference of Senochu's underlings. Susumu Ikuzawa, who has become a hero, is challenged by Hikaru Fuko, who has turned from BMX to cycle buggy, and becomes a rival. Susumu Ikusawa, who has gained strength, participates in the association's training camp as a candidate for the World Battle Kids, and wins the final candidate despite insidious interference."
