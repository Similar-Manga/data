   "en": "This novella depicts a future in which the Earth is under attack from space, which appears to be coming from nowhere. Much of Earth has already been reduced to scorched earth due to nuclear attacks from aliens, and there is no trace of its former self. The Earth Defense Force's Magellan, which the main character Michi Kusakari is on board, is a spaceship that frequently makes sorties into space to protect the Earth from such alien attacks. Nuclear bombs attacking Earth have many guard ships attached to them, and they attack spaceships that try to destroy the bombs. In outer space, a battle begins between the patrol ship and Magellan, but during the battle, the captain is attacked by the enemy and dies. Moreover, before he knew it, Magellan was being sucked into a black hole...\n\n■Finally, it has been suggested that this work is titled after Magellan, who circumnavigated the world by sea in the 16th century.\n\nNote: only collected in the 1988 edition of Earth number V7"
