   "en": "Sakura Matsushima, an elite detective at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, is instructed to seek the opinion of the head of Rangakujuku Yakumo in order to solve the mysterious incidents that have been occurring frequently lately. Yakumo Rangakujuku, which has been around since the Edo period, has produced many powerful people, such as the Prime Minister and the Superintendent of Police, even today, and the successive presidents have earned their respect and are said to have imparted their wisdom behind the scenes at every opportunity. However, when Matsushima asked about Yakumo Rangakujuku, the person who came out was a middle school student. However, he claims to be the 15th headmaster of the school, Jugoro Yakumo. According to Jugoro, recent incidents are mysterious incidents that cannot be solved by modern science. Matsushima is unconvinced by this explanation and by Jugoro, the school principal who is brash for his age, but as he solves a series of strange incidents with Jugoro, he changes his mind."
