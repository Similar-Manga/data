   "en": "198X. At the brink of nuclear war, scientists around the world collaborate to create a medicine which, when drunk by children, would turn them into geniuses. The scientists succeed in having them create a World's Children's League, and eventually bring about world peace. Ozma is the patrol captain at the Children's League's Japanese HQ.\n\nTen years prior, Ozma's father, Prof. Aoyama, discovered a new medicine, Robon-X, which when drunk with water turns organisms into a solidified state. The information becomes known to the Juda Society, who plot to conquer the world. Aoyama, afraid of his medicine being used for malicious purposes, enters solidified hibernation with his wife through drinking the medicine, and leaves the just-born Ozma behind...\n\n---\n**Volumes 114-118 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
