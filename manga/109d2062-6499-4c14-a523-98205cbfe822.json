   "en": "Fukuoka, the core city of Kyushu. Tamaki Agari, who came out of Miyazaki because she wanted to do something. She was used in a commercial as a substitute for her model by the CM production president Ransaku Kinema, whom she met at the movie theater. Her face is known all at once, and she becomes the center of attention in the neighborhood. She got angry and she went to work with Tamaki, but she was praised as a masterpiece better than a storyboard, which motivated her to take up the job. She was put to the test by Kinuma on her film knowledge and she passed without incident. What kind of commercial will Fukuoka's vague personality produce?"
