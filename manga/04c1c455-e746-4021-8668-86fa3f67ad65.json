   "en": "In 1976, the Yomiuri Giants managed to win the Central League, despite the lack of relief pitchers. Finding a relief pitcher was an urgent task. Then, in the winter of 1976, when Nagashima and Oh were walking around town, they met boys playing kusayakyu at an elementary school. Among them is Taki Kyojin, an elementary school boy who throws a fastball that puts the pros to shame. Nagashima decided that he would pass as a professional immediately, and although he was an elementary school student, he nominated Giant-kun in 3rd place at the draft meeting. After completing the one-month Miyazaki camp, he pitched for the first time and won his first victory in an open match. And finally, we enter the pennant race! A popular baseball manga that has been serialized in \"CoroCoro Comic\" since 1977."
