   "en": "The first ecchi in history.\n\nInitially serialized in Shonen Book briefly before switching to Weekly Shonen Jump. The nature of the content is very extreme with both teachers and students being involved in perverted situations. \n\nGo Nagai would include more extreme content at the encouragement of his editor. \n\nAs the manga continued its serialization, it garnered more and more controversy from parents. As a result, the Jump Editorial Dept. decided to cancel the serial. \n\nNagai, in response to the controversy, decided to end off the manga [End of part 1] with the very infamous \"Harenchi War\" (Shameless War) arc.\n\n*(spoiler)\nThe arc killed off the majority of the cast in a very gory and disturbing manner and remains a very infamous arc to this day.*\n\nShameless School is controversial in Japan even today and is regarded as a \"traumatic work\" by several news publications.\n\nThe manga consists of 3 parts, with the last left unfinished due to the cancellation. + last volume includes 3 chapters back story for Hige Gojira."
