   "en": "The countdown of the human species began.  \nThe sun has come closer to Earth, causing radioactive rays that kill all female fetus. Some mothers even died during their daughter's miscarriage due to hemorrhage.  \n  \nConfusion reigned homo sapiens' first phase of extinction: mate competition, countries vying for a solution, families losing their loved ones. The government has required all females to take tests to collect data for research on developing a cure. Ho Su was identified as the one who is immune to the radioactive rays emitting from the sun. To prevent war between nations over her, Professor Yun has kept his founding about her immune a secret and has persuaded Ho Su's father to let him freeze Ho Su in hibernation, waiting for a time when the situation has stabilized from chaos to experiment on her for a vaccine.  \n  \n30 years later.  \nIt is now the year of 2042. The world has became a place dominated by males. Women are virtually extinct with their number-count in the hundreds and the youngest of the them in her forties. It has been long accepted that a wife, being a gender so rare, can have multiple husbands. Sex change to satisfy sexual desire is a growing phenomenon, although is still looked down upon by society.  \n  \nIn such a disordered place where she is the only girl, Ho Su awakens."
