   "en": "Marybelle and her brother Antoine were offspring of a fine noble family in France. But with wicked step mother in line, trauma was guaranteed in their lives! Soon, the siblings were separated as they moved to England away from their wicked step mother. In England, Marybelle was adopted by the Lambert family. Nine years on, Marybelle and Robert, the eldest son of the Lambert family, were already deeply in love. Their relationship, however, was not approved by Robert's father, Duke Lambert. The duke was concerned for the reputation of his son, who would inherit his title one day, being tanished by Marybelle’s low status. In the end, he requested her to leave the family for good.\n\nIn her departure, Marybelle realised Robert's importance to her; so when Robert finally found her, Marybelle insisted on leaving him for his own sake. She also asked her new-found actor friend, Léandre to pretend to be her lover, hoping that Robert would give up on her. Eventually, Marybelle left Robert and returned to France with Léandre.\n\n(from mangaupdates)"
