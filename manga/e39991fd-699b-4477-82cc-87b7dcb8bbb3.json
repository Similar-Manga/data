Some of his most famous work as a character designer or director are \"Space Battleship Yamato\", \"Brave Raideen\", \"Combattler V\" and \"Mobile Suit Gundam\".\n\nIn 1979, he made his debut as a mangaka with \"Arion\" serialized in the newly founded magazine \"Ryu\". Following this, Yasuhiko alternated between the Anime and Manga worlds with works like \"Kiba - The Legend of White Fang\", \"Crusher Joe\", and \"Giant Gorg\", and \"Star of the Kurds\", \"C-Court\", and \"Venus Wars\".\n\nThese worlds would overlap, when his manga \"Arion\" would get adapted into an anime film in 1986 with the title \"Neo Heroic Fantasia: Arion\".

The anime film adaptation for \"Venus Wars\" came at an unfortunate point for Yasuhiko, and the film was sealed, preventing it from being made readily available on home video formats in Japan (though still made accessible overseas). He turned to manga completely and had gained a respectable reputation as a history mangaka with works focusing on both Japanese history with \"Jinmu\", \"Namuji\", \"Yamato Takeru\" and European history with \"Alexandros\", \"Joan\", and Theology with \"Jesus\".\n\nIn 2001 he adapted the First Gundam anime into a manga with \"Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin\" and was colossally popular, being serialized for 24 Tankoban volumes.\n\nWith over 50 years worth of experience across multiple mediums of entertainment and showing no signs of stopping, Yasuhiko's terrific worldview continues to touch the hearts of many around the world.\n\nIn 1981 he won the Seiun Award in the Art category. In 1992 he won the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for his work \"Namuji\"."
