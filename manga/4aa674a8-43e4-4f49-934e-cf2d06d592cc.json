   "en": "Mamoru Uchiyama, the legendary ultra manga artist, reprints the feature-length ultra comic of the 1970s and 80s electronically!\n\nIn 2010, as part of the 45th anniversary project of the Ultraman series, the \"Ultra Collection Box\" was released in a limited number of complete copies, and Mamoru Uchiyama's Ultraman comics 2 that were included in it are reprinted electronically in a combined book format! The first volume is \"Kagayake His Ultra Star\" (1973), which is not included in the comics! Mamoru Uchiyama's longest-running one-shot comic featuring the phantom character \"Ultra King\". The other one is also not included in the comics, \"Ultra Warrior Galaxy Great War\"! This is a feature film featuring Andromeros, which was serialized in Shogaku Sansei (1981-82). Both are reprinted in the same format as the grade-specific learning magazines at the time, including advertisements and Aori complaints! Also includes article projects such as scraped posters and work graffiti! In addition, the color illustration for the special issue of \"Monthly CoroCoro Comic\" at the time, which was enclosed as a postcard, is also included at the end of the book. An e-book collection for ultra fans! (The special figure of the paper book is not included.)"
