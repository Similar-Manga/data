   "en": "\"Aim to be No. 1 in the racing world!!\"\nThe first full-fledged racing work drawn by racing manga specialist Hisashi Sekiya\nhas been reprinted!!\nHiroshi, a car enthusiast, participates in a dangerous race, risking his life!!\nWhat is the true identity of the rival \"Black Lightning\" who doesn't show his true face?\n\nSynopsis\nMinamihiro, a boy who loves cars, runs away from the company after beating up the president's daughter.\nAlthough he is feeling nervous, he catches a bank gang and ends up getting a new job at Hayakawa Motors, a small factory. Hiroshi, who stakes his life on speed, decides to go racing in the Flash, which was built by his father.\nHowever, strong opponents such as the mysterious powerful racer Kuro Inazuma and\nFlash's former driver Kurohara take part in the race.\nWill Hiroshi be able to defeat his many rivals and become No. 1?\n\nExplanation\n\"Shonen No. 1\", which was serialized in \"Shonen Book\" in 1960, is the first\nwork by Hisashi Sekiya, who is known as a racing manga specialist.\nThis is a serious racing manga. When I started serializing this work, \nHisashi Sekiya didn't have a car or a license, and there wasn't much information available, so when he went to great lengths to research cars, he became a car enthusiast. This work's depiction of racing and the way the main character fights can be said to be the prototype for later full-fledged racing manga such as \"Inazuma Yaro'' and \"Barbara!! Racer.'' Also, \"Stop! Nii-chan'' and \"Banzai Tanteichou\".\nYou can see how much of an influence ``Shonen No. 1'' had on Sekiya 's later works from the depiction of carracing.\nThis time, in response to many reprint requests, we have reprinted all 6 volumes of previously published books. The powerful race scenes and comical characters are\na must-see even if you are not a fan of Hisashi Sekiya!!"
