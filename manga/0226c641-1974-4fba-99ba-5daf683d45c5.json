   "en": "The cruel chains of destiny threaten to condemn Louise to a life of slavery. Benjamin, an evil man obsessed with her mother even after her tragic death, takes Louise into his custody, intent on marrying her. Louise tries to escape this horrid fate and awakens eight years in the past. She’s set on making things right but is unable to stop tragedy once again. Determined to not give up, Louise embarks on a journey to find her father. What discoveries await her in this fight for freedom? Will her father be the key to her happiness... or her demise?\n\n---\nDespite not having a father, Louisa lived happily with her mother nonetheless. Then, one day, that happy life ended along with her mother’s death. Her uncle, Benjamin, who claimed himself as her guardian, took her in. He was the worst scumbag who desired even his niece. While she was in her uncle’s grasp, the only rebellious act she was capable of doing was to take her own life. However, for some reason, Louisa returned to the year her mother died. The joy of meeting her mother again soon vanished, as she couldn’t prevent her mother from dying again. So, she eventually left to find her father. Her mother’s words, \"Your father is alive,\" were the only clue she had to change her destiny in this life. Escaping from Benjamin, she had barely managed to make it to her father’s house… But her father was not the only one there…?"
