   "en": "Superman:\nOne day, Saenochi, an ordinary middle-aged office worker, is stalked by an elderly man who calls himself ``Superman'' and begs him to follow in his footsteps and become Superman. Saenochi did not take it seriously and did not deal with it, but when he learned of his daughter's crisis, he reluctantly agreed to take it on.\n\nThe ``super clothes'' he inherited have various abilities, and he has to use them to fight day and night for justice, in between work and home. However, the opponents that Saenai fights are not evil organizations or monsters, but only everyday troubles.\n\nFuture:\nOnce a popular manga artist, Rihito Noto was on the verge of declining after the serial manga ``Jikū Senki'', which he had devoted his entire career to writing, was discontinued. He had no hope in his daily life, and for many years it seemed like he was sustaining his life through inertia. One day, Nato makes a hole-in-one, hole-in-one at the publisher's golf competition that he participated in, causing him to faint from shock."

Their real names are Hiroshi Fujimoto (藤本 弘, Fujimoto Hiroshi, 1933–1996) and Motoo Abiko (安孫子 素雄, Abiko Motoo, 1934-2022). They formed their partnership in 1951, and used the Fujiko Fujio name from 1954 until dissolution of the partnership in 1987.\n\nFrom the outset they adopted a collaborative style where both worked simultaneously on the story and artwork, but as they diverged creatively they started releasing individual works under different names, Abiko as [Fujiko Fujio Ⓐ](https://mangadex.org/author/b755f10f-ad3d-4b22-ae7a-214025d70e72/fujiko-fujio-a) (藤子不二雄Ⓐ, Fujiko Fujio Ē, credited as Fujiko A. Fujio outside Japan), and Fujimoto as Fujiko F. Fujio (藤子・F・不二雄, Fujiko Efu Fujio). Throughout their career they won many individual and collaborative awards, and are best known for creating the popular and long-running series Doraemon, the main character of which is officially recognized as a cultural icon of modern Japan. Some influences of most of their projects are the works of acclaimed manga artist [Osamu Tezuka](https://mangadex.org/author/21575d70-b954-4e3a-80df-00192f413a83) and many US cartoons and comic books—including the works of Hanna-Barbera."
