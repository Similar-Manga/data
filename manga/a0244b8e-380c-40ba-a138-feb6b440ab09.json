   "en": "(from ebookjapan):\nIn the summer of 1944, at the end of World War II, a young airman, Jotaro Taki, arrived at Kaohsiung Air Base in southern Taiwan to join the 701st squadron, which was organized with the famous \"Shiden\" aircraft. Although training had been the only thing he had been doing, Taki was soon given the opportunity to participate in actual combat. Taki, who had taken the liberty of leaving the formation and flying alone, received a lot of flak, but was accepted by his comrades. One day, he receives an urgent order to attack the U.S. military base at Marcotte in the Philippines with only the 701st Squadron... What is war? What are we fighting for? The coming-of-age of a boy aviator in agony between life and death!"
