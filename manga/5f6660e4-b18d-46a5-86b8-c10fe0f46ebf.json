   "en": "Daisuke Takamura was a powerful pitcher who excited Koshien. While his career path after graduation is attracting attention, the unconventional Daisuke nominates neither the 12 professional baseball teams nor the major leagues as the team he will join, but the professional wrestling organization ``New Tokyo Pro Wrestling.''\n\nDaisuke , who switched from baseball to professional wrestling and made a big announcement in the media that he would defeat Kanji Kaiou, a fighter who is said to be the strongest, ended up making many people his enemies.\n\nDaisuke's mother is surprised that Daisuke and Kaiou met. His father, Kosuke Takamura , who died when Daisuke was young, had a deep relationship with Kaiou. Daisuke and Kaiou's meeting was not a coincidence but fate.\n\nAs Daisuke continues to fight against the martial artist who is aiming for Kaiou's head, he comes to know the truth behind the relationship between Kaiou and his father."
