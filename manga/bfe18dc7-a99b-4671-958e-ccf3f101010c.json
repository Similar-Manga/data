   "en": "This book is written by Jiro Kuwata, a manga artist who has created many masterpieces such as \"8 Man,'' \"Moonlight Mask,'' and \"Phantom Detective,'' and explores the essence of the human spirit through the heroic life of sword master Miyamoto Musashi and the Book of Five Rings. This is a Taiga Gekiga drawn by the author. Musashi, a young man who dreams of rising through the ranks through the art of swordsmanship and martial arts, participates as a member of Toyotomi's Western Army in the Battle of Sekigahara, which marks the dividing of the world, in order to make a name for himself, but the Western Army is defeated. Musashi himself was deeply injured and was on the verge of life and death when his life was saved by Zen Master Takuan, a traveling monk who was passing by the battlefield. The drama begins about a young samurai who, after meeting his mentor and a strong man, will be able to reach the \"path of the spirit\" beyond the \"path of the sword\"!"
