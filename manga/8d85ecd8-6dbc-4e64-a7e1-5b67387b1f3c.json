   "en": "The fate of the world is entrusted to one young ninja... The long-awaited reprint of the legendary full-length work by master Sanpei Shirato!! The time is a world of war. Ishimaru, a boy who lost his parents in the war, was picked up by Ishigumo, a Koga ninja, and spent all his time training in ninjutsu deep in the mountains of Shinshu. Eventually, Ishimaru grows up to be a full-fledged ninja, and his teacher Ishigumo reveals the existence of the \"Tome of Dragon Smoke.\" The Book of Dragon Smoke contains a terrible secret that could destroy the world, and it has been protected by Koga-ryu ninja for generations, and now Sekigumo is in charge of it. However, Ishigumo was killed by someone and the Book of Dragon Smoke was stolen from him!! Ishimaru, who inherited his master's will, keeps appearing one after another, defeating the assassins who stand in his way, and protecting world peace. Is it possible!? A fierce battle over the Tome of Dragon Smoke begins! First published in \"Weekly Shonen Magazine'' (Kodansha) 1960 Issues 29-52 \"Kaze no Ishimaru'' is a ninja manga series. This is a full-length ninja action drama published in 1960 in Shonen Magazine (Kodansha) by master Sanpei Shirato as his first weekly serial. It is full of highlights, such as the hard and beautiful touch, the ninjutsu with scientific elements unique to Shirato's works, the foreshadowing throughout, and the basic setting that later became part of the original work of the anime ``Fujimaru of the Wind''. However, its greatest appeal lies in its unique characters. The story progresses from the perspectives of various characters, including Ishimaru's rival Iga ninja Hayate Kozo, the mysterious boy Netaro, the Kyushu ninja sword style, and the swordsman Yagyu Jubei who also uses ninjutsu, vividly depicting the emotional entanglement with the main character Ishimaru. There is. In response to many requests, we hope that you will feel the author's feelings for peace in this taiga work, which has been revived in modern times for the first time in about 50 years."
