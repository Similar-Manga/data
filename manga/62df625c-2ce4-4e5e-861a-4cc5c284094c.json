   "en": "Is it the fate of two strong men to fight a duel and kill each other? \n\nTwo world-famous professors, Takamure and Hebinuma, were always at each other, and ultimately partook in a duel. Their brains put out strong electric currents. However, Hebinuma's currents are stronger than Takamure's, and he is killed.  Takamure's son, Z, is rescued by a robot, Jet, and is raised in secret in a volcano. \n\n10 years later, Z is a strong boy, but the people hate him because of Hebinuma's slander. Can Z prove that Hebinuma is in the wrong, and clear his name?\n\n---\n**Volume 52 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**"
