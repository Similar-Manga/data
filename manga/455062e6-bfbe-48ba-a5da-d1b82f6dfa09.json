     "en": "Naoki Urasawa (Japanese: 浦沢 直樹, Hepburn: Urasawa Naoki, born January 2, 1960) is a Japanese manga artist and musician. He has been drawing manga since he was four years old, and for most of his professional career has created two series simultaneously. The stories to many of these were co-written in collaboration with his former editor, Takashi Nagasaki. Urasawa has been called one of the artists that changed the history of manga and has won numerous awards, including the Shogakukan Manga Award three times, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize twice, and the Kodansha Manga Award once. By 2016, his various works had over 126 million copies in circulation.\n\nHis early style was inspirational and warm youth growth manga, and then turned to a deep discussion of human nature and social phenomena, covering topics such as history, psychology, criminology and science fiction. He was a 1960s and 1970s rock fan. It's influence can be strongly reflected in the *20th Century Boys*. He likes Bob Dylan very much.\n\n"
