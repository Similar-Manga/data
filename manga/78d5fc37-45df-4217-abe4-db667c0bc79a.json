   "en": "One day, an old man sitting on a bench in a park calls out to an office worker on his way to work. The old man was sitting in the same place even when the office worker went home. As the office worker approaches the old man, the old man pulls out a kitchen knife from his bag. And he asked, ``What do you think you can do with this?'' The next day, the office worker sits next to the old man, overlooking the bus he always takes, and asks the old man to show him the knife again. And he asked what he thought he could do with it. The old man replies, \"Anything.\" Office workers weren't the only ones who were attracted to the old man's knife. A young man who was beaten by yakuza, and a high school student who was fed up with his mother. On the day they gather on the old man's bench, the old man offers to ride the kindergarteners' school bus"
