   "en": "A cyber hazard has occurred, and the network society is in chaos! In the midst of this, there were those who were active for the distribution of humanity, regardless of whether it was legal or illegal. These are door-to-door couriers who deliver “everything, anywhere” using traditional network-independent delivery systems. They were called deliveries by the people. Keima Intercept Delivery, aka \"KID\", a shipping company famous both inside and outside the industry, has been receiving various requests. Keimayoku, a high school student who dreams of becoming a racer while helping out in the family business, his father So, a former elite of the Ministry of Distribution and a brilliant hacker, and Oh, the grandfather of the legendary delivery company. Don't miss this near-future human empathy story that depicts the activities of \"KID\", a transportation company run by three generations of parents and children!"
