   "en": "The “school wars” of youth are about to break out!\nFrom the hit maker duo of Hisao Maki “Waru” \u0026 Toshio Shoji “Yuyake Bancho”.\nThe first book of the unprecedented soccer drama!!\n\nCommentary\n\"Kake the Clouds!\" is a youth soccer giant story that was started serialized in 1970 by \"Shonen Champion\" (Akita Shoten) to commemorate its weekly publication. Yes!\nAt that time, the Japanese national soccer team won the bronze medal at the Mexico Olympics (1968).\nThe golden duo of Kamamoto and Sugiyama was admired by all the boys.\nGiven the trends of the times, it seems likely to be a work with a pure sports spirit, but\nIt is a sharp depiction of the psychology unique to the original author Hisao Maki. Toshio Shoji, who is riding a wave with the success of ``Yuyake Bancho'', dares to draw in a gekiga style, resulting in an exciting and unconventional work that goes beyond the conventional genre of sports spirit.\n\nSynopsis\nTetsuya Kokubu, a student yakuza who made a name for himself in the Ginza/Yurakucho area, graduated from university with the aim of realizing his dreams.\nAt the same time, he left the group and was assigned to a high school in Aomori as a teacher.\nHowever, the high school is a veritable chaos ruled by a mysterious group of delinquents known as the Blood Alliance, who use ninjutsu skills.\nKokubu sees a piece of his dream in their cohesiveness, and tries to ask for their cooperation, sometimes confronting them head-on, and sometimes using psychological warfare!\nEventually, he realizes the existence of a mastermind manipulating the Blood Pact behind the scenes...\nWhat is the true identity of the mastermind?\nWhat is the \"dream\" that Kokubun continues to burn with passion?!?"
