   "en": "As a child, Chiyoko loved chocolate, and loved her dad the chocolatier even more. But after he suddenly disappeared, she grew up detached and cold, and now hates the taste of chocolate. Her dad’s old chocolate shop still stands, and as she passes by one day she notices that it’s reopening under the same name, selling the same homemade chocolates. Not only that, but the new chocolatier there is a girl whose name is also Chiyoko! Can this new Chiyoko bring back some warmth — and chocolate — into our Chiyoko’s life?  \nA 1-volume series."
