   "en": "A man who was a prison guard has reached retirement age. He did his best in his own way. He has no regrets. However, the only thing that comes to mind is the one time he lied to a prisoner. A prisoner's car is heading to the prison. Along the way, a veteran who has been to prison many times asks the guard to open the curtains because there is a cherry tree that blooms in autumn called Mikaeri-zakura. When I looked at it, there was only one cherry tree in bloom, even though it was actually autumn. The inmates scream in surprise and joy, but only Kei, a young yakuza, refuses to watch, saying it's a shame. Kei goes to prison as a substitute for the murder committed by a group leader. He believed his words that he would make him an executive once he was released from prison."
