   "en": "1-3: Same Cell Organism, I Love You, Lullaby In My Hand  \nNakagawa and Yokota are two boys very much in love with each other. Yokota is more open with his feelings, while Nakagawa is easily embarrassed by public displays of affection. Though they may be outwardly different, their feelings for each other are the same. Their connection is such that they liken themselves to same-cell organisms.  \n  \n4: The Letter In The Attic  \nTwo lonely boys visit a favourite spot.  \n  \n5-6: To Make An Angel  \nAn angel follows a young boy throughout his life.  \n  \n7: We Selfish Two  \nSora is in love with Midori, a kindergarten teacher."
