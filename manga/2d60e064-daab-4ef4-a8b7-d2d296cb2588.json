   "en": "From Toothpaste Scanlations:  \n  \nOnly the rich, upper-class students get to attend the private school, Ootari Gakuen. The ordinary girl who transferred to this campus was Oogisaki Minori. Minori originally dreamed of having a happy school life, but she never thought that there would possibly be a reputative Student Enforcement Council full of cute guys, who through their strict rules, control the whole school! Not only that, but on Minori's first day of school, she was picked on by them!  \n  \nAlso includes:  \nHappy Tea Time  \nInstead of going overseas with her parents, Nao decides to live with some relatives who own a cake shop called Peach Garden. The owners had to go to Tokyo so that left Nao with their three sons. Will Nao be okay living in a house only with guys?"
