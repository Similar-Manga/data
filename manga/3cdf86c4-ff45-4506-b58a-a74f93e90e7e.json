   "en": "The man she accidentally spent a night with was a formerly wolf-eared idol?!\n\n\"A three room apartment in the metropolitan area + a foreign car + retirement with guaranteed pension and savings.\" That was the dream goal of 29-year-old pharmacist Han Sooji, who used to be a passionate fan of the idol group LUPUS back in her school days. However, due to several problems and a member’s departure, the group was forced to disband. Her young heart was scarred as she thought her steamy dreams were over, but…? LUPUS's former member, as well as the leading cause of the disbandment, is now getting ready to return to the entertainment world. After meeting Kim Beomchan, aka Jackie, and spending a bewildering night together, she promised to be a reliable friend. She also learned about LUPUS's unfortunately troubling past from the former members.\n\nSigh… Actually, this is pharmacist Han Sooji and 'Jackie' the traitor’s plan, 'hope for Kim Beomchan's safe and mishap-free return'!\n\n---\nAs a teen, Sooji was heartbroken when her favorite idol group LUPUS disbanded, thanks to the traitorous member Jackie quitting. Ten years later, Sooji has become a workaholic pharmacist who just wants a stable, predictable life. But she's thrown for a loop when she suddenly runs into Jackie—at an animal shelter, of all places! After learning that he plans to return to showbiz, Sooji is enraged and picks a fight with him... starting a deep dive into the untold ups and downs of LUPUS and it members. What really happened behind the scenes to Jackie all those years ago, and can Sooji, now along for the ride, survive his path back to stardom?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%8A%91%EB%8C%80%EA%B0%80-%EC%9A%B0%EB%8A%94-%EC%95%BD%EA%B5%AD/2613), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home/53805174)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://www.tappytoon.com/comics/pharmacy-where-wolf-howls)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [French / Français](https://www.delitoon.com/webtoon/la-pharmacie-du-loup-qui-pleure)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Wolf-and-the-Pharmacist/401)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/48354)"
