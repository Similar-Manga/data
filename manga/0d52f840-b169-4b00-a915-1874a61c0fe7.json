   "en": "A few years after `` Meimon! Third Baseball Club '', Asunaro Hinoki , who retired from professional baseball, was the manager of Sakura High School's baseball team. Going back four years, substitute pitcher Rin Uesugi, who was brought in with the Koshien preliminaries on the verge of losing, showed glimpses of a fastball pitcher. Although Asunaro's former colleague, Ryuichi Jin , recognized his talent and encouraged him to go to university in order to help him make a mark, Asunaro's former colleague, Ryuichi Jin, did not become a hot topic due to his lack of control.\n\nFor four years, all he did publicly in the world of college baseball was doing chores such as washing regular players' uniforms, but the same chore worker who admired him explained why the tatami mats in the large dormitory room were scraped. The younger members of the club knew this. When Kami comes to check on Uesugi's accomplishments in college baseball, he is disappointed by his outward appearance, but upon learning of his hard work behind the scenes, Chiba Mullins drafts him despite being a low-ranking player. When he first joined the team, no one paid any attention to Uesugi, who had no track record in amateur baseball and was drafted at the bottom of the draft. However, Kuwamoto, one of the few talented star players on the team, and Kaido's Golden Battery (who also knows Hinoki Asunaro best when he was at his peak) immediately saw through Uesugi's extraordinary talent. In particular, Kuwamoto was very conscious of saying, ``I will never give up my position as ace.''\n\nHowever, an organization that tries to make Chiba Marines do their will begins to act behind the scenes, and Uesugi, Kuwamoto, and Kaido also become involved in the Chiba Marines' organizational conflict."
