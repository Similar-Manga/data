   "en": "Following the development of virtual reality, Thera, a revolutionary and ultra-realistic online game to the almost infinite universe is born. Inside, everyone can become what they want and experience many adventures. But for Sakuu, the first immersion turns into a nightmare: unable to disconnect, he finds himself a prisoner of a virtual world populated by wild creatures. Without access to the interface of the game nor to the items of care, who knows what will happen to him if it loses the life in Thera ... And it is not the only one in this situation: its road crosses that one Other players who are victims of the same problem. For these Outlaw Players, game over is not an option. Whatever the cause of the bug, Sakuu and his companions have no choice: they must harden, explore, learn, and sue.\n\n___\n\nOutlaw Players was originally an online comic book published in 2002 before being paused and thought of as \"a succession of anecdotes about online video games, more humor-based which relies on Mechanics of MMOs \". The author, Shonen, therefore had to \"take up the project and reflect on a more coherent framework and concept\" during the series adaptation.\nIn order to keep up with the slower release rate than in Japan, the first four volumes were completed before the series was launched and quarterly planing was put in place for the first six volumes. The serie benefits a trailer by the Japanese animation studio Gonzo.\nThe series is published in the sense of Japanese reading by editorial choice, \"not to break the codes of the manga for the French readership but also in order to facilitate the sale of the series in Japan\"."
