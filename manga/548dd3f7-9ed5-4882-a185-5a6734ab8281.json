   "en": "A mysterious person that everyone knows!!\nA complete reprint of the popular special effects TV show manga!\n\nThe messenger of justice who comes from the ocean floor,\nhis name is Underseaman 8823 (Hayabusa)!!\n\nCommentary\n\"Underseaman 8823 (Hayabusa)'', which has been aired on Fuji Television since 1960,\nis a special effects program of Daiei Television, written by Ken Kuronuma and produced by the original story and screenplay.\nThe scene in which he first appears, \"He slipped on the red clay, his life support machine came off, and he was about to die'' is very famous (of course, this episode is also recreated in the manga version!).\nThe original author, Ken Kuronuma, is the author of \"Radon, the Great Monster of the Sky'' and \"Great Monster Baran,'' and is also a science fiction writer and a researcher of supernatural phenomena. This work also captivated viewers with its sense of having 8823 read as \"Hayabusa'', the setting in which the boy appears when he blows a flute, and the presence of an alter ego (machine) that looks exactly like 8823 (Ruby: Hayabusa). This time, we will be reprinting the manga drawn by Ippei Kuri, which was made into a \"Shonen'' comic at the same time as the TV broadcast, as a [complete version]. This is a work that brings back memories of the era when special effects heroes were very active on TV!!\n\nSynopsis:\nUnderseaman 8823 (Hayabusa) is an ally of justice who comes from the undersea kingdom.\nHe is called by the sound of a 30,000-cycle whistle that cannot be heard by human ears, and begins to fight gangsters and evil aliens who are targeting Earth."
