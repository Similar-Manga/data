And if that's not crazy enough, soon Kuro is able to magically transform into a human! With his dog now taking the form of a hot man and licking him in various places, what is Ukyo to do?! Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?  \n  \n2) Inu mo Arukeba Burning Love  \nKuro and Ukyou's story continues! It's time for a nice relaxing walk…  \n  \n3) Inu mo Arukeba Getting Love  \nMore of Kuro and Ukyou!
