   "en": "Two years ago, Anju was dating Shoma from a track and field club. However, on the day of his graduation, Shoma said something that hurt Anju so much that she decided to forget about him. Now, to Anju’s surprise, the man her mother is going to marry turns out to be Shoma’s father, which means she and her ex will be siblings from now! Meeting Anju after a long time, Shoma presses her against the wall saying that he’ll do what he didn’t back then. He starts fondling her breasts, her hard nipples, and touching her private parts. It was him who rejected her in the past, so why is he touching her now?"
