   "en": "In the autonomous city of Ainz Territory, magic and wizardry have flourished, becoming increasingly sophisticated. The tranquility of this region was shattered by a young man with an unusual appearance—beautiful yet missing an eye, an arm, and a leg. This young man was none other than Ainz Silvetas, the legendary magician who laid the groundwork for everything two thousand years ago!\n\nTime passed while he secluded himself in a cabin in the woods, and when he ventured out after reaching a deadlock in his research, he found that his “notes” had been deemed a holy scripture known as the “Magic Tome,” and he himself was being worshipped as a “Demon God.”\n\nUnaware of his newfound status, he casually sets out on a journey to pursue his curiosity in magic. As he touches upon the laws of the world, he unintentionally throws nations out of balance! This is the carefree tale of the strongest Demon God in a full-scale fantasy."
