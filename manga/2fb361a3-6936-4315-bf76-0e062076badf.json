   "en": "“Manga-based junior high school entrance exams” for elementary school students!\n\nThe trend has continued for nearly 10 years, with one in five people in the Tokyo metropolitan area taking the junior high school entrance exams. This book introduces the junior high school entrance exams that have become so familiar to elementary school students in an easy-to-understand manner. The main character transfers to Tokyo from a local city, enrolls in a preparatory school by chance, and takes the entrance exam for a prestigious junior high school. By reading this manga, you can enjoy understanding how junior high school entrance exams are conducted today. There are also plenty of reading articles supervised by Nichinoken, a major cram school, such as \"How to choose the school that is right for you'' and \"Health management for the remaining 3 months before the entrance exam,'' making this book a must-read for both those who are taking the entrance exam and those who are not. !\n\n[Recommended information from the editor]\nThere are many guide books for junior high school entrance exams aimed at parents, but here is a manga aimed at elementary school students about junior high school entrance exams. This is the first children's book that I have explained. \"Entrance exams'' tend to have the image of \"competition'' and \"the supremacy of standard deviations,'' but if you read this, you'll see the other side!"
