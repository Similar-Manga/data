  "description": {
   "en": "London at the beginning of the 20th century. What is the true identity of the mysterious man ``Baron Phantom Thief Bat'' who helps the weak and frustrates the strong? Sachiko Asuka's masterpiece, that romantic and stylish suspense comedy, is finally back! ! Don't miss this masterpiece girls' manga from the Showa era following \"Yukiko Tani\"!\n\nSachiko Asuka's \"The Phantom Thief Bat Baron\" first appeared in Kodansha's \"Weekly Shojo Friend\" in 1967, then Shueisha's \"Weekly Seventeen\" in 1969, Shogakukan's \"Weekly Shojo Comic\" in 1973, and other weekly magazines from three companies. This is a popular suspense comedy series released in. Set in post-World War I London, the story was very popular at the time of its release, depicting a number of incidents surrounding an unknown robber named Baron Bat. In contrast to the stylishness of Baron Bat, who appears with a fluttering black cloak, Professor Isaac Asimov is a versatile genius scientist but a bit clumsy (we implicitly understand that he is Baron Bat!), and a beautiful woman. It features attractive characters such as the strong-willed newspaper reporter Betty, and the story is full of suspense, action, romance, a bit of slapstick, serious scenes with occasional dark shadows of history, and plenty of parody.\nThis fantastic series, which has been difficult to read for many years, has now been compiled into one volume for the first time. In addition, it includes valuable unreleased episodes and two spin-off short stories. This is truly a \"definitive edition!\" that fans of the past cannot miss no matter what.\n\nIn addition, three unique short stories from outside the series are also included. (\"The Strange Story of Elsinore Castle,\" \"Monsieur Monsieur's Great Strategy,\" and \"The Beautiful Vampire\") Even those who come into contact with Sachiko Asuka's works for the first time can enjoy her diverse charm.\nOf course, this is a fulfilling book that also includes an interview with Sachiko Asuka and a list of her works.\n\nSpecial contribution by manga artist Yasuko Sakata. Sakata, who was greatly influenced by Sachiko Asuka's manga, passionately talks about her encounter with Baron Bat on page 4!"
