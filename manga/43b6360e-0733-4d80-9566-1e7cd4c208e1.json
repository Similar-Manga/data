   "en": "After graduating from university, Yoshioka joined his dream job, CBS, and was assigned to the last news program of the day, ``Last News,'' which starts at 11:59 p.m. and only airs for 11 minutes. One day, producer Hino chooses new photographic evidence of a representative's innocence in a 200 million yen bribery case as the subject of a broadcast. From this photo of Tanabata that was leaked by the representative's secretary, Hino discovers new facts that overturn the evidence."
