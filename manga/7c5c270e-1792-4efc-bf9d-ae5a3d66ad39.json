   "en": "1-2: As You Say, Young Master! \u0026 As You Please, Young Master!  \nOne day, Tokoha, the son of the wealthy Katsuragi family, was ordered by his father to undergo some arranged-marriage plans. Hoping to escape from his father's continuous proposals, Tokoha told his father that he likes men – and thus his father should give up on planning an arranged marriage for him. To convince his father, he asked the butler Asou to pretend to be his lover. At first, Tokoha slept with Asou only to deceive his father. But as time passed, he derived great pleasure from their relationship. How will the fake love between the cool butler and the young master continue?  \n  \n3: Kiss For Reward  \nTanigawa has been Arisu-sensei's student since Arisu was in college: first as a home-tutor student, and now as a student in the school where Arisu works. Tanigawa has changed so much, from a child to a man… except for one thing: he always asks for a kiss if he gets 100 on his tests! Arisu feels that he should put an end to this, but how does Tanigawa feel about that?  \n  \n4: Can't Wait To Feast On You  \nKumi has been with Ayato, his bodyguard/butler, since he was a child. Kumi always thought he felt \"big brotherly\" love toward Ayato… until he saw a woman kissing him. Realizing he was in love with Ayato and that he would not be able to have him to himself, Kumi decided to flush discretion down the toilet and sleep with any girl he could get his hands on. That backfires of course and Kumi finds himself under the knife of an angry boyfriend…  \n  \n5: In Heat Limit  \nKuro was abandoned in the rain when he was a kitten. A beautiful white cat, Shiro, saved him and brought him back home where Kuro has lived ever since. Kuro has always been clingy around Shiro, but recently Shiro seems to be avoiding him. Depressed, Kuro thinks Shiro doesn't like him… but maybe its just that Shiro is in heat…  \n  \n6: It Feels Like A Honeymoon  \nMasaya just got a new brother: his classmate, Tomoyuki. Their parents fell in love at first sight, and now they're family. Masaya continues his womanizing ways until their classmates start joking that Tomo and Masaya are like newlyweds… suddenly, Masaya can't take his eyes off his new brother.  \n  \n7: Between The Fangs  \nLittle Chris was dying on the streets when a man named Luke saved him, whom he discovered to be a vampire. Chris has been staying in Luke's house and serving him for 10 years now, waiting for Luke to keep his promise to turn him into a vampire as well. Although Chris is now 18, Luke does not want to turn him…? But Chris is determined to become a vampire and stay with Luke forever… whatever the cost."
