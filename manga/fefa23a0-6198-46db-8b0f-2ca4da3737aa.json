   "en": "A 32yo wife with a strong sensibility for the supernatural who is trying to become pregnant with her husband. One night during sex with him she suddenly realizes she's watched by a ghost. Shame due to her lackluster performance beats her fear for some reason. From this day onward, the ghost appears night after night and... becomes part of her sexuality. When he puts her body in sleep paralysis, her bound body is reminded of bondage and the wife becomes wetter than ever!"
