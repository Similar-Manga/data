   "en": "A comic version of the hit special effects drama!!\nHikaru, a young boy raised by esper alien parents, sets out to protect the earth from\nthe clutches of the \"space invaders\" alien Giron. \"Light Speed ​​Esper'' (Nippon Television Network), which aired from 1943 to 1966, is a special effects drama featuring a life-sized hero who is reborn as an invincible light speed esper using a reinforced suit with seven abilities. It was a huge hit. Originally, \"Light Speed ​​Esper'' was a character created by electronics manufacturer Toshiba to be used as a mascot doll for its affiliated shops and for advertisements. In 1966, a comic series was started in Kobunsha's magazine \"Shonen'' by the manga artist Asano Riji, who was in charge of the design. Generally speaking,   when it comes to the manga \"Light Speed ​​Esper,'' the Leiji Matsumoto version that started serialization in the later stages of TV broadcasting is famous, but in a true sense, the roots can be called the Asano Riji version, which was involved in the birth of the mascot. In that sense, this first book release is a groundbreaking event not only for manga fans but also for special effects fans."
