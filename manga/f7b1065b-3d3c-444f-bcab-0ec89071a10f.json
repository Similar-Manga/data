   "en": "Raito, a third-year junior high school student, is a track and field sprinter. Just when he was finally able to participate in the tournament, he broke an important leg in a traffic accident and had no choice but to give up participating in the tournament. And three months later, a visitor who can't heal his emotional wounds goes on a trip for a change of pace at the recommendation of those around him. At a ranch in the plateau, he meets Yuka, the trainer of the equestrian club \"Tail Lodge\", and Reverie the horse. I was very moved by the thrill and comfort of manipulating a horse. Raito, completely captivated by horses, visits the ranch every holiday and helps Yuka as a part-time job. A visitor who likes horses more and more every time he comes into contact with them. After finally finding something to enjoy other than track and field, he decides to participate in a horse riding competition!"
